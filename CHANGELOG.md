# Changelog

All notable changes to FlowFreq (formerly HydroLib) are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Renamed to `flowfreq`** — package, import name, distribution and display name.
  `from hydrolib.core import kfactor` is now `from flowfreq.core import kfactor`;
  the console script is `flowfreq`. Historical entries below keep the old name,
  since they describe what shipped at the time.

  The old name was unusable. Deltares publishes `hydrolib` and `hydrolib-core` on
  PyPI, both installing a top-level `hydrolib/` package, and `hydrolib-core` ships
  `hydrolib/core/` against this project's `hydrolib/core.py`. Installed together
  one silently destroys the other -- in one order this library's entire API
  disappears, in the other neither package imports at all -- and `pip check`
  reports nothing wrong. `flowfreq` names what the library does (flood *and*
  low-flow frequency) and cannot be mistaken for HYDROLIB.

### Added
- Native Python port of `var_mom` and its dependency tree (`mn2mvarb`/`mse_ema`, `detrat`,
  `VAR_EMAB`/`regmoms`/`ci_ema_m3b`), verified routine-by-routine against the vendored
  peakfq 8.1.0 Fortran. See TODO.md's P3 section for the full account.
- `MethodOfMoments` now applies the Bulletin 17B conditional-probability adjustment: a
  low-outlier (PILF) threshold — Grubbs-Beck or user-supplied — censors the fit instead of
  only being reported.

### Changed
- `ExpectedMomentsAlgorithm` confidence intervals are now Cohn's asymmetric bounds
  (`hydrolib._var_emab.var_emab`) instead of the symmetric `log_Q ± z*se` approximation.
- `ExpectedMomentsAlgorithm`'s at-site EMA moment iteration on censored intervals now uses
  the Fortran-verified truncated-moment code (`hydrolib._p3_moments.m_p3`) and the correct
  bias-correction sample size, closing a real accuracy gap on any record with censored
  intervals (Big Sandy's historical gap years included, not just MGBT-flagged PILFs).
- Regional skew weighting now includes ADJE's censoring bias adjustment and the Halloween
  determinant ratio (`detrat`), matching peakfq's default `at_site_option`.

### Fixed
- `hydrolib/peakfqsa/` (a subprocess wrapper around a PeakfqSA binary that does not exist)
  removed; it was mock-tested only. `hydrolib/validation/reference.py` covers what it
  contributed, pointed at references that actually exist.
- Bare `except:` in `usgs.py` narrowed to the actual failure modes.
- `analyze_gage()` no longer prints unconditionally to stdout; uses `logging` like the rest
  of the library.

### Removed
- `hydrolib/peakfqsa/` and its mock-only test suite (see Fixed, above).

## Notes on Versioning

- **0.x.x** — Pre-release. API may change without warning.
- **1.0.0** — Stable API. Breaking changes require major version bump.
