# Uploading the peakfqr Fortran Source & Reference Materials

**Purpose:** get the USGS Fortran EMA source and its reference/test material out of the
local-only workspace (`C:\a\hal\_shared\peakfqr`) and into this repository, so that the
remaining numerical errors can be root-caused against the authoritative implementation and
a parity test suite can be built on direct Fortran-vs-Python comparison.

Audience: whoever is working on the machine that holds `C:\a\hal\_shared\peakfqr`.
Everything below runs there.

**If you only do one thing:** copy `_shared/peakfqr/src/emafit.f` into
`vendor/peakfqr/src/`. A previous session narrowed the last open numerical defect to three
routines inside that one file — `var_mom`, `EXPMOMCDERIV`, `DEXPECT` — and stopped rather
than guess at the formula (§1.4). Everything else here makes the work reproducible and
testable; that file makes it *possible*.

---

## 1. Why this is blocking

### 1.1 The Fortran bridge does not exist outside one machine

`flowfreq/peakfqr/` currently contains **only build output**, no source:

```
flowfreq/peakfqr/
├── __init__.py
├── _emafort.cp312-win_amd64.pyd   <- Windows-only, CPython 3.12-only binary
├── libgfortran-5.dll
├── libgcc_s_seh-1.dll
├── libquadmath-0.dll
└── libwinpthread-1.dll
```

`build_fortran/build.py` compiles it from `C:\a\hal\_shared\peakfqr\src`, an absolute path
that exists on exactly one computer. The consequences:

- `from flowfreq.peakfqr import emafitpr` raises `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named
  'flowfreq.peakfqr._emafort'` anywhere else — including this checkout (Linux, CPython 3.11).
- `.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs on `ubuntu-latest` across Python 3.9–3.12. The bridge
  can never load there, so **no CI job has ever exercised the Fortran path**.
- `docs/vignette_streamlit_web.md` claims the shipped `.pyd`/`.so` "should work on Linux
  (Streamlit Cloud runs Ubuntu)". That is not correct — a `.pyd` is a PE32+ Windows DLL.
  Fix that line as part of this work.

Without the sources in-repo, the reference implementation cannot be rebuilt, read in
context, or run by anyone but its author.

Worth knowing why that matters more than it looks. The original build brief
(`AGENT_BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS_Claude.md`, §7) specified PeakfqSA as "~45,000 lines of
Fortran-95" invoked as a **standalone executable**, and `flowfreq/peakfqsa/` — config,
wrapper, io_converters, parsers, validators — was built to that spec as a subprocess
wrapper. That premise turned out to be wrong; `TODO.md` records the correction under
Resolved Questions: *"PeakfqSA: Not a standalone binary. Use peakfqr `src/` Fortran as
reference code."* So that entire subsystem drives a binary that does not exist. Its tests
are mocks, and every `requires_peakfqsa` test is permanently deselected.

The f2py bridge in `flowfreq/peakfqr/` is therefore not one of two ways to reach the
reference implementation — it is the only one. Which makes the missing sources the single
thing standing between this repo and any real comparison against USGS Fortran.

### 1.2 Three tests fail purely from missing reference data

`tests/peakfqsa/test_r_fixtures.py` resolves data through `../../../../_shared/peakfqr/...`,
i.e. it reaches *outside* the repository:

| Test | Needs |
|---|---|
| `TestSkewWeightingFixtures::test_load_whist_cases` | `inst/testdata/results_WHIST.csv` |
| `TestSkewWeightingFixtures::test_whist_case_values_in_range` | same |
| `TestMomentsWymtFixtures::test_expected_csv_files_exist` | the four `wymt_ffa_2022A_*` CSVs |

### 1.3 The remaining numerical failures need the Fortran to adjudicate

**Read the branch state before trusting any failure count.** Three branches carry different
Big Sandy results, and the two that matter are *both unmerged*:

| Branch | Big Sandy | Q100 CI lower | Q100 CI upper | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| `main` | 16 failed / 127 passed repo-wide | 1.19 % | 12.29 % | 11 quantiles + `std_log` also fail |
| `claude/library-overview-JbAcS` | 2 failed / 19 passed | 9.00 % | **10.53 %** | best upper CI, symmetric; degrades lower |
| `claude/flowfreq-edt-attributes-mm2aif` | **4 failed / 17 passed** | 3.36 % | 17.34 % | best quantiles; worst upper CI |

CI figures are measured at a common 5 % / 5 % tolerance. `library-overview-JbAcS` reports
"21 passed" on its own tolerances (10 % lower, 12 % upper) — it is green because its gates
are wider, **not** because it is more accurate. Compare deviations, never pass counts.

`claude/flowfreq-edt-attributes-mm2aif` is the current authoritative state: **4 failures.**

- `test_quantile[0.995]`, `test_quantile[0.99]` — the most *frequent* events, off ~2–2.7 %.
- `test_confidence_interval[0.02]`, `[0.01]` — the *rarest* events, upper bound only, off
  ~10–17 % and growing with return period. Lower bounds and the point quantiles at those
  same AEPs match.

### 1.4 What earlier sessions already established

Do not re-derive these. Recorded in `TODO.md` under "Open Questions" and in the commit
messages on the two branches above:

- **Root cause of the bulk of the old failures: found and fixed.**
  `_auto_configure_ema_params()` was guessing the historical perception threshold from
  `max(historical peak values)` — 25 000 instead of Big Sandy's actual 18 000. Honoring an
  explicitly-provided `perception_thresholds` entry resolved **9 of the original 13**
  failures (`f1d334c`). `b8fb275` on the other branch fixed the same bug independently.
- **Ruled out by independent verification.** The two lowest-level EMA primitives — truncated
  gamma moments and the LP3→gamma parameter transform — were checked against brute-force
  numerical integration and are **exact**. The residual is not there.
- **The standing diagnosis.** `FloodFrequencyAnalysis.compute_confidence_limits()` uses one
  closed-form asymptotic variance (`1/n + K²(1+0.75G²)/(2(n−1))`, the Bulletin 17B/MOM
  approximation) with `n = n_systematic`. `emafitpr` does not do this. It uses **Inverse
  Modified Cholesky Gaussian Quadrature** (added to `emafit.f` Oct 2012) and derives a
  **Pseudo Effective Record Length** (`as_G_PRL_o`) from the historical/censored portion of
  the record to widen and reshape the interval. Neither is implemented here. That gap
  matches the observed signature precisely: a defect confined to the upper CI at rare
  events, on a record whose censored portion is exactly what PRL is computed from.
- **The blocker.** Pinning down and *verifying* the replacement formula requires reading
  `emafit.f` — specifically `var_mom`, `EXPMOMCDERIV`, and `DEXPECT`. A previous session
  stopped here deliberately rather than guess at a formula, and left the 4 tests **failing
  rather than skipped**, on the grounds that this is a real open numerical question and not
  a missing-dependency one. That judgement is why this upload exists.

### 1.5 A merge decision has to happen too

`claude/library-overview-JbAcS` (4 commits: B17C Appendix 4 skew MSE, `n_intervals` skew
weighting, the skew-uncertainty CI variance term with `kfactor_skew_derivative()`, and a
systematic-only EMA regression test) is on **neither** `main` **nor**
`claude/flowfreq-edt-attributes-mm2aif`. It is stranded, and it is the only work that
attacks the upper-CI term directly — it is what took that error from ~19 % to 10.5 %.

The two branches are complementary and have never been combined. **That merge has now been
run as an experiment** — see §1.6 for the result and the recipe. Land it before generating
any golden files, or the goldens will encode a state nobody ships.

### 1.6 The merge experiment: run, and it changes the ask

Merging `library-overview-JbAcS` into `flowfreq-edt-attributes-mm2aif` is nearly clean —
both source files auto-merge, and the single conflict is a tolerance line whose two sides
are numerically identical (`TOLERANCE_PERCENT * 2` vs `2.0`). Two things need a human,
though, and neither announces itself:

1. **Git textually merges both perception-threshold fixes.** Each branch fixed the same bug
   in `_auto_configure_ema_params()` in a different place — `library-overview` with a
   pre-loop that takes `min(threshold)` and can establish the historical period from
   thresholds alone, `edt-attributes` with a post-block that overrides using the *first*
   match. Merged, both survive, and the post-block silently overwrites the pre-loop's
   `min()`. Same answer on Big Sandy (one historical period), divergent on any site with
   several. Resolve to a single block — the pre-loop is the superset.
2. **The auto-merge takes the looser CI tolerances** (10 % / 12 %, from `library-overview`),
   so the suite goes green without anyone choosing that. Re-tighten to 5 % / 5 % before
   believing any number.

Measured at a common 5 % / 5 % tolerance, with a full-suite regression check:

| State | Big Sandy | Q100 CI lower | Q100 CI upper |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| `flowfreq-edt-attributes-mm2aif` | 4 failed / 17 passed | 3.36 % | 17.34 % |
| `library-overview-JbAcS` | 2 failed / 19 passed | 9.00 % | 10.53 % |
| **merged** | **2 failed / 19 passed** | 9.00 % | 10.53 % |

The merge picks up `library-overview`'s quantile accuracy — the two AEP 0.99 / 0.995
failures are gone — with no regressions anywhere else (341 passed; the only other failures
are the three §1.2 reference-data tests and one live-NWIS call blocked by the sandbox).
Big Sandy is down to **2 failures, both CI**.

**And the CI residual is not what it looked like.** Decompose the intervals in log10 space,
where the code computes `log_Q ± z·se_log`:

| AEP | point-estimate error | total log10 width vs expected | upper/lower half-width ratio, expected | …actual |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 0.1 | −0.45 % | 0.979 | 1.043 | 1.000 |
| 0.02 | −0.06 % | 0.999 | 1.531 | 1.000 |
| 0.01 | +0.14 % | 0.978 | 1.727 | 1.000 |

The point estimates are essentially exact and **the total width is already within ~2 %**.
The actual ratio is 1.000 at every AEP *by construction* — a symmetric `± z·se` interval
cannot be anything else. PeakfqSA's interval is increasingly right-skewed with return
period, and that growing asymmetry is the entire remaining error.

Confirm it directly: keep the merged code's own total width and merely re-split it using
PeakfqSA's asymmetry ratio.

| AEP | bound | expected | as-is | re-split |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 0.02 | lower | 15 155 | −6.66 % | **−0.04 %** |
| 0.02 | upper | 29 124 | −6.70 % | **−0.09 %** |
| 0.01 | lower | 17 388 | −9.00 % | **+0.76 %** |
| 0.01 | upper | 37 986 | −10.53 % | **−0.94 %** |

Every bound lands inside 1 %. This is a diagnostic, not a fix — the asymmetry ratio was
taken *from* the reference, so it shows which quantity is wrong without supplying its
value. But it relocates the ask precisely: the merged variance **magnitude** is right, so
`var_mom` is no longer the prime suspect. What is missing is the mechanism that makes the
interval asymmetric — the **Inverse Modified Cholesky Gaussian Quadrature**, which
integrates the skewed sampling distribution instead of assuming normality about the point
estimate. A normal approximation cannot produce a 1.73 ratio no matter how its variance is
computed.

The merged result is pushed as **`claude/merge-b17c-accuracy-5gj1s1`** (merge commit
`675e647`, parents `039f983` and `e1a66fb`), with the two hazards above resolved, CI
tolerances restored to 5 % / 5 %, and the 2 remaining failures left failing rather than
masked. Full suite there: 344 passed, 6 failed — those 2, the three §1.2 reference-data
tests, and one sandbox-blocked live NWIS call.

**Recipe**, to reproduce it from scratch:

```bash
git checkout -b combined origin/claude/flowfreq-edt-attributes-mm2aif
git merge origin/claude/library-overview-JbAcS
# 1. tests/validation/test_big_sandy.py: the two conflict sides are identical, keep either
# 2. flowfreq/bulletin17c.py: delete the trailing perception-threshold override
#    block in _auto_configure_ema_params(); keep the pre-loop
# 3. tests/validation/test_big_sandy.py: restore CI tolerances to 5 / 5
pytest tests/ -q
```

## 2. What to upload

Vendor the material under `vendor/peakfqr/`, mirroring the upstream layout so paths in the R
package and in `TODO.md` still read correctly.

### Group 1 — Fortran sources (required)

Copy the **entire** `src/` directory; it is small and inter-dependent.

| Source | Destination | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `_shared/peakfqr/src/emafit.f` | `vendor/peakfqr/src/emafit.f` | **The single highest-value file.** `emafitpr` (authoritative EMA entry point) plus the three routines the open CI defect turns on — `var_mom`, `EXPMOMCDERIV`, `DEXPECT` — and the Inverse Modified Cholesky Gaussian Quadrature block. Also `mseg_all_sub`, `p3est_ema`, `detratsub`. |
| `_shared/peakfqr/src/dcdflib1.f90` | `vendor/peakfqr/src/dcdflib1.f90` | distribution functions |
| `_shared/peakfqr/src/imslfake.f` | `vendor/peakfqr/src/imslfake.f` | IMSL shims |
| `_shared/peakfqr/src/probfun.f` | `vendor/peakfqr/src/probfun.f` | `qP3sub`, `PLOTPOSHS`, probability functions |
| `_shared/peakfqr/src/*` (anything else) | `vendor/peakfqr/src/` | `Makevars`, `Makevars.win`, headers, any further `.f`/`.f90` |

### Group 2 — Call-convention reference (required)

| Source | Destination | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `_shared/peakfqr/R/fortranWrappers.R` | `vendor/peakfqr/R/fortranWrappers.R` | the specification `build_fortran/_emafort.pyf` was written against: exact argument order, log10 conversion, `pq = 1 − AEP`, output field extraction |
| `_shared/peakfqr/R/*.R` (the rest) | `vendor/peakfqr/R/` | surrounding logic: skew weighting, MGBT, PSF parsing |
| `_shared/peakfqr/DESCRIPTION`, `NAMESPACE` | `vendor/peakfqr/` | version provenance — records *which* peakfqr the numbers came from |

### Group 3 — Test data (unblocks §1.2, feeds §5)

| Source (under `_shared/peakfqr/inst/testdata/`) | Destination (under `vendor/peakfqr/inst/testdata/`) |
|---|---|
| `results_WHIST.csv` | same |
| `wymt_ffa_2022A.psf` | same |
| `wymt_ffa_2022A_WATSTORE.TXT` | same |
| `wymt_ffa_2022A_EXPinfo_7_4.csv` | same |
| `wymt_ffa_2022A_EXPdata_7_4.csv` | same |
| `wymt_ffa_2022A_EMPdata_7_4.csv` | same |
| `wymt_ffa_2022A_MGBT_7_5_1.csv` | same |
| `extra_tests/HU02/` (whole directory) | same — backs `tests/peakfqsa/fixtures/hu02_stations.py` |

### Group 4 — Upstream R tests (recommended)

| Source | Destination | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `_shared/peakfqr/tests/testthat/test-fortran.R` | `vendor/peakfqr/tests/testthat/` | origin of `tests/peakfqsa/fixtures/fortran_respec.py` — lets us verify the transcription |
| `_shared/peakfqr/tests/testthat/test-skewweight.R` | same | origin of `skew_weighting.py` |
| `_shared/peakfqr/tests/testthat/test-moments.R` | same | origin of `moments_wymt.py` |

### Group 5 — Documentation (optional, small)

The original build brief treats these as first-class reference, and it is right that they
are useful; they are simply not on the critical path for the open CI question.

| Source | Destination | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `_shared/peakfqr/man/` | `vendor/peakfqr/man/` | parameter descriptions, units, valid ranges, edge-case notes |
| `_shared/peakfqr/vignettes/` | `vendor/peakfqr/vignettes/` | end-to-end worked examples, input → frequency curve |

### Do NOT upload

- Compiled objects: `*.o`, `*.mod`, `*.dll`, `*.so`, `*.pyd`, `src-x64/`, `mbuild/`.
- `.Rproj` / IDE state.

---

## 3. Before you copy: three checks

**a. License / redistribution.** peakfqr is USGS-authored and normally public domain, but
confirm before vendoring: open `DESCRIPTION` and any `LICENSE`/`LICENSE.note` in the package
root and copy them to `vendor/peakfqr/` alongside the code. Add a short
`vendor/peakfqr/README.md` recording upstream name, version, retrieval date, and license.
If the license turns out to restrict redistribution, stop and raise it — do not push.

**b. Size.** Fortran sources and R are a few hundred KB. `extra_tests/HU02/` may not be.
Measure first:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Recurse "C:\a\hal\_shared\peakfqr\inst\testdata" |
  Measure-Object -Property Length -Sum |
  ForEach-Object { "{0:N1} MB" -f ($_.Sum / 1MB) }
```

Under ~50 MB: commit it plainly. Over that: upload the Group 3 files the tests actually
name, and subset `HU02/` to the stations listed in `tests/peakfqsa/fixtures/hu02_stations.py`.
Do not reach for Git LFS for text data of this size.

**c. Line endings — this one silently corrupts Fortran.** `.f` files are **fixed-form**:
columns 1–5 label, column 6 continuation, columns 7–72 statement. An editor that converts
tabs to spaces, strips trailing whitespace, or rewrites line endings can break compilation in
ways that are invisible in a diff. Land the `.gitattributes` in §4.1 **before** the first
`git add` of any Fortran file, and copy with a byte-preserving tool (`copy`, `robocopy`,
`cp`) — never paste through an editor.

---

## 4. Changes to land alongside the upload

### 4.1 `.gitattributes` — **DONE** (`941aecd`)

Landed on this branch already, before any Fortran source exists — which is the point.
Nothing to do here; recorded so the reasoning survives.

Two attributes doing different jobs, and it is worth being precise about which one
actually protects the source:

- **`text eol=lf`** makes the repository store **one** consistent line ending regardless
  of who commits. Be clear about what this is not: upstream peakfq ships CRLF, so on the
  first `git add` git reports *"CRLF will be replaced by LF the next time Git touches
  it"* for every Fortran and R file. That is the rule working as intended, but it means
  the stored bytes are **normalized, not byte-identical to upstream** — a checksum
  against the original tree will not match. Nothing is lost that matters: normalization
  touches only line terminators, never intra-line content, so the column structure that
  fixed-form Fortran depends on is untouched, and gfortran accepts either form.
- **`whitespace=-trailing-space,-tab-in-indent`** is the load-bearing one. It tells git
  *not* to treat trailing whitespace and indent tabs as errors in these files, which
  stops `git apply --whitespace=fix` and `git rebase --whitespace=fix` from stripping
  them. That stripping is the corruption that matters: fixed-form Fortran puts the label
  in columns 1–5, a continuation marker in column 6, and the statement in 7–72, so
  anything that shifts characters sideways changes the program while the diff still reads
  as whitespace.

What landed covers more than the original draft: `.for`/`.f77` and the uppercase
`.F`/`.F90` variants (which conventionally mean "preprocess first" and are equally
sensitive), plus `Makevars`/`Makevars.win`, where Make requires a literal TAB to open a
recipe line and expanding it breaks the build outright.

`vendor/peakfqr/inst/testdata/**` is `-text`, so byte-exact expected output is never
normalized. This is the half of the split where byte-identity genuinely matters, and it
is observable: the fixture files produce **no** CRLF warning on `git add`, precisely
because nothing is being rewritten. Source normalized, fixtures preserved exactly.

Trade-off: git treats the fixtures as binary and shows no textual diff — acceptable for
data that is not meant to change, and worth knowing before you go looking for one.

Verified two ways before committing: `git check-attr` confirms every path in the §2
manifest resolves to the intended rules, and `git add --renormalize .` confirms no
currently tracked file changes as a result (`build_fortran/_emafort.pyf` is the only
existing file matching a new rule, and it is already LF).

### 4.2 `.gitignore` — one trap

Line 7 is `*.so`. Once the extension builds on Linux/CI, `flowfreq/peakfqr/_emafort*.so`
will be **silently ignored**. That is the correct default (build output does not belong in
git), but it is worth making explicit so nobody loses an hour to it:

```gitignore
# Build output — the Fortran extension is compiled from vendor/peakfqr/src, never committed.
flowfreq/peakfqr/_emafort*.so
flowfreq/peakfqr/_emafort*.pyd
build_fortran/mbuild/
build_fortran/native.ini

# Per-machine Claude Code settings (share .claude/settings.json if you want to).
.claude/settings.local.json
```

`build_fortran/mbuild/` and `build_fortran/native.ini` are both generated by
`numpy.f2py --backend meson`, so any worktree where the extension has already been built
shows them as untracked. They are outputs, not inputs — ignore them, never commit them.

Verified: nothing in the current `.gitignore` blocks any path in the §2 manifest.

### 4.3 `build_fortran/build.py` — remove the hardcoded path

It currently pins `src = r"C:\a\hal\_shared\peakfqr\src"` and a `LOCALAPPDATA` Windows Store
Python path, so it runs on one machine only. Replace the path resolution with:

```python
import os
import shutil
import subprocess
import sys
from pathlib import Path

REPO_ROOT = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent
SRC = Path(os.environ.get("PEAKFQR_SRC", REPO_ROOT / "vendor" / "peakfqr" / "src"))

if not SRC.is_dir():
    sys.exit(
        f"Fortran sources not found at {SRC}.\n"
        "See docs/FORTRAN_UPLOAD.md — vendor/peakfqr/src must be populated."
    )

# Order matters: emafit.f references symbols from the others.
sources = [SRC / n for n in ("emafit.f", "dcdflib1.f90", "imslfake.f", "probfun.f")]
missing = [str(p) for p in sources if not p.is_file()]
if missing:
    sys.exit("Missing Fortran sources:\n  " + "\n  ".join(missing))

if sys.platform == "win32":
    mingw_bin = os.environ.get("MINGW_BIN", r"C:\msys64\mingw64\bin")
    if Path(mingw_bin).is_dir():
        os.environ["PATH"] = mingw_bin + os.pathsep + os.environ["PATH"]

for tool in ("gfortran", "meson"):
    if shutil.which(tool) is None:
        sys.exit(f"ERROR: {tool} not found on PATH")

build_dir = Path(__file__).resolve().parent
cmd = [
    sys.executable, "-m", "numpy.f2py",
    "-c", *(str(p) for p in sources),
    "-m", "_emafort",
    "--backend", "meson",
    "--build-dir", str(build_dir / "mbuild"),
]
print("Running:", " ".join(cmd))
sys.exit(subprocess.run(cmd, cwd=build_dir, env=os.environ).returncode)
```

This keeps the existing Windows/MSYS2 behaviour, adds an env override, and makes the build
work unchanged on Linux and macOS once the sources are in-repo.

### 4.4 Fixture paths — stop reaching outside the repository

Two places walk up four directory levels to `_shared/`. Point them at the vendored copy.

`tests/peakfqsa/fixtures/skew_weighting.py` — replace the `_WHIST_CSV` block:

```python
from pathlib import Path

REPO_ROOT = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[3]
TESTDATA_DIR = REPO_ROOT / "vendor" / "peakfqr" / "inst" / "testdata"
_WHIST_CSV = str(TESTDATA_DIR / "results_WHIST.csv")
```

`tests/peakfqsa/test_r_fixtures.py` — replace the `testdata_dir` expression in
`TestMomentsWymtFixtures::test_expected_csv_files_exist`:

```python
from tests.peakfqsa.fixtures.skew_weighting import TESTDATA_DIR
testdata_dir = str(TESTDATA_DIR)
```

Confirm `parents[3]` resolves to the repo root from
`tests/peakfqsa/fixtures/skew_weighting.py` — `fixtures` → `peakfqsa` → `tests` → root.

### 4.5 `docs/vignette_streamlit_web.md`

Correct the claim that the bundled `.pyd`/`.so` works on Linux (§1.1). State instead that the
Fortran extension is optional, is built from `vendor/peakfqr/src` via `build_fortran/build.py`,
and that FlowFreq falls back to the native EMA path when it is absent.

## 5. Upload procedure

Run on the machine holding `C:\a\hal\_shared\peakfqr`.

**Pick a shell first.** The blocks below are Git Bash. `cmd.exe` will not run them —
`SHARED=/c/a/hal/...` is bash syntax and cmd answers *'SHARED' is not recognized*.

Do **not** just type `bash` at a `C:\>` prompt. On Windows that resolves to
`C:\Windows\System32\bash.exe`, the WSL launcher, which fails with
`WSL (10 - Relay) ERROR: CreateProcessCommon:800: execvpe(/bin/bash) failed` when no WSL
distro is installed. Git Bash is a different program:

```
"C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe"
```

Launch that (or Git Bash from the Start menu, or right-click → *Git Bash Here*) and the
blocks below work as written. **If you would rather not, use §5a — PowerShell is always
present and needs no setup.**

**Step 1 — get onto the designated branch.**

```bash
cd /c/a/hal/hybrid-17c-cld
git fetch origin
git checkout -B claude/fortran-code-github-upload-5gj1s1 origin/claude/fortran-code-github-upload-5gj1s1
git status --short          # see below before you start
```

A worktree that has already built the extension will not come up empty here. Expect
`build_fortran/mbuild/` and `build_fortran/native.ini` (f2py/meson output) and possibly
`.claude/` — all covered by §4.2, none of them blocking. What *should* stop you is any
untracked or modified file you do not recognise: identify it before adding anything, so it
does not get swept into a commit alongside the vendored sources.

**Step 2 — `.gitattributes`: already done (`941aecd`, §4.1).** It is on this branch, so
just make sure you have it before adding any Fortran:

```bash
git pull                    # must include 941aecd
ls .gitattributes           # verify it is present before the first `git add` of .f
```

**Step 3 — copy the material.**

```bash
SHARED=/c/a/hal/_shared/peakfqr

### 5a — PowerShell equivalent of Step 3

Same copy, native. Run from anywhere; paths are absolute.

```powershell
$Shared = "C:\a\hal\_shared\peakfqr"
$Repo   = "C:\a\hal\hybrid-17c-cld"
$Vendor = "$Repo\vendor\peakfqr"

New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path `
  "$Vendor\src", "$Vendor\R", "$Vendor\inst\testdata", "$Vendor\tests\testthat" | Out-Null

Copy-Item "$Shared\src\*" "$Vendor\src\" -Recurse -Force
Copy-Item "$Shared\R\*.R" "$Vendor\R\"   -Force
Copy-Item "$Shared\DESCRIPTION", "$Shared\NAMESPACE" "$Vendor\" -Force
Get-ChildItem "$Shared\LICENSE*" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
  Copy-Item -Destination "$Vendor\" -Force

$fixtures = @(
  "results_WHIST.csv", "wymt_ffa_2022A.psf", "wymt_ffa_2022A_WATSTORE.TXT",
  "wymt_ffa_2022A_EXPinfo_7_4.csv", "wymt_ffa_2022A_EXPdata_7_4.csv",
  "wymt_ffa_2022A_EMPdata_7_4.csv", "wymt_ffa_2022A_MGBT_7_5_1.csv"
)
$missing = @()
foreach ($f in $fixtures) {
  $src = "$Shared\inst\testdata\$f"
  if (Test-Path $src) { Copy-Item $src "$Vendor\inst\testdata\" -Force }
  else                { $missing += $f }
}
if ($missing) { Write-Warning "Not found in the reference tree: $($missing -join ', ')" }
Copy-Item "$Shared\inst\testdata\extra_tests" "$Vendor\inst\testdata\" -Recurse -Force

Copy-Item ("$Shared\tests\testthat\test-fortran.R",
           "$Shared\tests\testthat\test-skewweight.R",
           "$Shared\tests\testthat\test-moments.R") "$Vendor\tests\testthat\" -Force

# strip any build output that came along
Get-ChildItem $Vendor -Recurse -Include *.o, *.mod, *.dll, *.so, *.pyd |
  Remove-Item -Force
```

Then verify (the §5 Step 4 checks, in PowerShell):

```powershell
Get-Content "$Vendor\src\emafit.f" -TotalCount 5
(Select-String -Path "$Vendor\src\emafit.f" -Pattern 'subroutine\s+emafitpr').Count  # expect >= 1
git status --porcelain --ignored vendor/ | Select-String '^!!'                  # expect nothing
"{0:N1} MB" -f ((Get-ChildItem $Vendor -Recurse -File |
                 Measure-Object Length -Sum).Sum / 1MB)
```

`Copy-Item` is byte-preserving, so the §3c warning still holds: copy with these commands,
never by pasting file contents through an editor.

**Step 4 — verify before staging.**

```bash
# Fortran arrived intact and un-normalized
head -5 vendor/peakfqr/src/emafit.f
grep -ciE 'subroutine[[:space:]]+emafitpr' vendor/peakfqr/src/emafit.f   # expect >= 1
file vendor/peakfqr/src/*.f                                    # "ASCII text", not "CRLF"

# nothing in the manifest is being ignored
git status --porcelain --ignored vendor/ | grep '^!!' || echo "OK: nothing ignored"

# size sanity
du -sh vendor/peakfqr
```

**Step 5 — commit in reviewable pieces.**

```bash
git add vendor/peakfqr/src vendor/peakfqr/DESCRIPTION vendor/peakfqr/NAMESPACE vendor/peakfqr/LICENSE*
git commit -m "feat(fortran): vendor peakfqr Fortran sources (emafitpr and dependencies)"

git add vendor/peakfqr/R
git commit -m "docs(fortran): vendor peakfqr R wrappers as call-convention reference"

git add vendor/peakfqr/inst/testdata vendor/peakfqr/tests
git commit -m "test(fortran): vendor peakfqr reference test data and upstream R tests"

# then the §4.2–4.5 code changes
git add .gitignore build_fortran/build.py tests/ docs/
git commit -m "fix(fortran): resolve build and fixture paths from vendored sources"

git push -u origin claude/fortran-code-github-upload-5gj1s1
```

**Step 6 — rebuild from the vendored copy and confirm nothing regressed.**

```bash
python build_fortran/build.py
python -c "from flowfreq.peakfqr import emafitpr; print('bridge OK')"
pytest tests/ -q
```

### Definition of done

- [ ] `vendor/peakfqr/src/emafit.f` present, `subroutine emafitpr` greps clean.
- [ ] `python build_fortran/build.py` succeeds **from the vendored sources**, with no path
      outside the repo (temporarily rename `C:\a\hal\_shared\peakfqr` to prove it).
- [ ] The three `test_r_fixtures.py` failures from §1.2 pass.
- [ ] Big Sandy failure count is unchanged by the upload — 4 on
      `claude/flowfreq-edt-attributes-mm2aif`, 2 on the §1.6 merge. The upload must make
      the numerics diagnosable, not perturb them.
- [ ] `git status --porcelain --ignored vendor/` shows no `!!` entries.
- [ ] `vendor/peakfqr/README.md` records upstream version, retrieval date, and license.

## 6. Root-causing the remaining failures

Work the ladder below **in order** on Big Sandy (USGS 03606500), from the merged state of
§1.6, where 2 failures remain, both CI. Each rung feeds the next; the *first* mismatch is
the root cause and everything below it is downstream noise. Do not skip ahead — a `cmoms` difference means nothing if the
two codes censored different observations.

What changed since this doc was first drafted: quantiles now agree at 10 of 12 AEPs, so
rungs 1–3 are **expected to pass**. Run them anyway — they are the cheap confirmation that
the two codes are fitting the same data, and they are what makes a rung 4–6 mismatch
trustworthy. The real work is rungs 4–6, and the headline target is rung 6.

| # | Fortran output | Question it answers | Expectation / if it differs |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `gbval`, `gbnlow`, `gbnzero`, `gbns` | Same MGBT low-outlier threshold and censored count? | Expected to match. If not, the two codes are fitting **different data** — stop and fix MGBT; nothing downstream is meaningful. |
| 2 | `qlema`, `quema`, `tlema`, `tuema`, `nu` | Same EMA interval representation after thresholds? | Expected to match now that the 18 000 perception threshold is honored (§1.4). A mismatch means the fix is incomplete — check `lmissing = -80.0` and the ±1e20 conventions in `TODO.md` §2. |
| 3 | `cmoms[0,0]`, `cmoms[1,1]`, `cmoms[2,2]` | Same mean, variance, skew? | Expected to match within ~0.3 %. Compare all three columns — col 1 regional+at-site, col 2 at-site only, col 3 B17B MSE. |
| 4 | `as_G_mse_o`, `as_G_mse_Syst_o`, `Wdout` | Same skew MSE and determinant-ratio weight? | The `n_intervals`-vs-`n_observed` choice (84 vs 47) was reasoned about but never verified against Fortran. This is where that gets settled. Read `detratsub` and `mseg_all_sub`. |
| 5 | `yp` | Same quantiles given identical moments? | Two known residuals at AEP 0.99 / 0.995 (~2–2.7 %). Both are at the *frequent* end where `K` is small — suspect `qP3sub` / the K-factor, not the fit. |
| 6 | `var_est`, then **`ci_low`/`ci_high` asymmetry**, then `as_G_PRL_o` | Same variance — and is the interval *skewed* the same way? | **The headline defect, and §1.6 narrows it to shape, not size.** Expect `var_est` to roughly agree (total width is within ~2 %). The live question is how `ci_low`/`ci_high` come out asymmetric about `yp` when a `± z·se` interval cannot: read the Inverse Modified Cholesky Gaussian Quadrature block (`emafit.f`, monotonicity enforcement ~lines 485–491), then `as_G_PRL_o` and how it feeds that quadrature. `var_mom`, `EXPMOMCDERIV`, `DEXPECT` back it up. |

Rung 6 is the reason for the upload. Per §1.6 the variance magnitude is close and the
asymmetry is absent, so the quadrature is what to read first — `as_G_PRL_o` matters as its
input, not as the defect. Pulling `ci_low`, `ci_high` and `yp` for Big Sandy out of the
Fortran and forming `(ci_high − yp)/(yp − ci_low)` at each AEP is one cheap comparison that
settles it, and is worth more than any further reasoning from the Python side.

### 6.0 Rung 6, answered

The upload is done and the extension builds, so this no longer needs predicting. Built on
Linux from the vendored sources (gfortran 13.3.0, meson 1.12.0, numpy 2.4.6) and run on Big
Sandy through `emafitpr` with the call convention taken from
`vendor/peakfqr/R/fortranWrappers.R` — `reg_M=0/-1e99`, `reg_SD=1/1e99`, `r_G=-0.5`,
`r_G_mse=0.3025`, `gbthrsh0=-99`, `pq=1-AEP`, `eps=0.90`, `wght_opt_n=1` (HWN).

Asymmetry ratio, `(log ci_high − log yp) / (log yp − log ci_low)`:

| AEP | manual | **Fortran** | flowfreq |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 0.10 | 1.043 | **1.032** | 1.000 |
| 0.02 | 1.531 | **1.311** | 1.000 |
| 0.01 | 1.727 | **1.408** | 1.000 |

**The diagnosis in §1.6 is confirmed.** The Fortran produces an interval that skews further
right as the return period grows; `compute_confidence_limits()` returns exactly 1.000 at
every AEP because `log_Q ± z·se` cannot do otherwise. The mechanism is real, it is in
`emafit.f`, and it is absent from this codebase.

`as_G_PRL_o` also comes back as a concrete number — **54.373** for this record, sitting
between `n_systematic` (44) and `n_observed` (47), nowhere near `n_intervals` (84). Nothing
in `flowfreq` computes it.

**But the Fortran does not reproduce the manual either**, and that is the new open question.
Its quantiles land within ~0.5 % mid-range while drifting to −3.4 % at AEP 0.995 and −1.8 %
at 0.002, and its Q100 asymmetry is 1.408 against the manual's 1.727. Two candidate causes,
and they need separating before anyone tunes Python against these numbers:

1. **The input setup is not identical.** This run defines the censored historical period as
   1890–1929 minus the three known peaks (37 intervals, `ql=Qmin`, `qu=18000`) and MGBT
   returned `gbnlow=0`, no PILFs. The manual's run may differ.
2. **Vintage mismatch, which would be worse.** The fixture's expected values come from the
   2012 PeakfqSA manual; the vendored reference is peakfq **8.1.0**, and `TODO.md` §4 notes
   the Inverse Modified Cholesky Gaussian Quadrature was *added to `emafit.f` in Oct 2012*.
   If the CI method changed after the manual was written, `EXPECTED_CONFIDENCE_INTERVALS`
   may simply not be reproducible against this code — in which case the two `xfail`-ed tests
   are measuring against a target that no longer exists, and the fixture needs regenerating
   from peakfq 8.1.0 rather than the Python being adjusted to match it.

Settle (1) before (2): re-run with the manual's exact perception-threshold and PILF
configuration. If the quantiles still miss at the tails, it is (2).

### 6.0b Chasing candidate (1): ruled out — it is the vintage

Candidate (1) was "my input setup differs from the manual's". It does not, in any way that
matters. Three lines of evidence:

**The data setup is right.** The fitted mean comes back as **3.717508** against the manual's
**3.717272** — off by 0.0063 %. A wrong interval count, a wrong censoring bound or a
misplaced perception threshold cannot leave the first moment intact to six parts in a
hundred thousand. The 84 intervals (44 systematic + 3 historic + 37 censored at 18 000) are
what the manual fitted.

**No configuration reproduces it.** Swept, all against the same intervals:

| varied | values tried | effect |
|---|---|---|
| `dtype` for censored years | 1, 0 (0 is what `siteQT` sets) | **none — bit-identical** |
| `tu` | 1e20, 1e50 | **none — bit-identical** |
| `wght_opt_n` | 1 HWN, 2 ERL, 3 INV | skew −0.1563 / −0.1659 / −0.1563 |
| skew option | Weighted, Generalized, Station | −0.1563 / −0.5000 / +0.0066 |
| `eps` | 0.90, 0.95 | upper CI −14.2 % / −6.4 % |
| PILF | MGBT, none | **none — bit-identical** |

Nothing lands on the manual. Where one column gets close another breaks: Station skew
matches the upper CI to **+0.40 %** and the asymmetry to 1.694 vs 1.727, but puts the skew at
+0.0066 against −0.1187 and Q100 5.5 % high.

**The smoking gun is the skew weighting.** At-site skew is +0.00660 and peakfq 8.1.0 reports
`as_G_mse = 0.09437`. Put that MSE through the *standard* Bulletin 17C weighting:

| | regional weight | weighted skew | vs manual |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| manual's −0.118702 implies | 0.2473 | −0.118702 | — |
| standard B17C using 8.1.0's own `as_G_mse` | 0.2378 | **−0.113862** | +4.1 % |
| what 8.1.0 actually returns | — | **−0.156306** | −31.7 % |

The standard formula, fed 8.1.0's own reported MSE, lands within 4 % of the manual. 8.1.0's
*internal* weighting does not — it is doing something else. `fortranWrappers.R` says exactly
what: HWN is *"a generalization of the PeakFQ 7.4.1 algorithm using an optimized adjustment
factor when censored data are present. Results are identical to PeakFQ 7.4.1 when no
censored data are present."* Big Sandy has 37 censored intervals, so HWN diverges **by
design** — and the 2012 PeakfqSA manual predates it.

**Conclusion.** `EXPECTED_PARAMETERS` and `EXPECTED_CONFIDENCE_INTERVALS` are 2012-vintage
and are not reproducible by peakfq 8.1.0. The two `xfail(strict=True)` cases are measuring
against a target that no longer exists, so no amount of tuning `compute_confidence_limits()`
will reach them — and tuning toward them would be fitting to a superseded method.

**What to do instead.** Regenerate the Big Sandy expectations from peakfq 8.1.0 and keep the
2012 values alongside as historical record. The extension builds, so this is now mechanical.
That converts Big Sandy from an unreproducible historical benchmark into a live parity test
against the reference the repository actually vendors — which is what §6.1 was always for.
The genuine defect found in §6.0 is unaffected and still needs fixing: flowfreq's interval is
symmetric by construction (1.000) where the Fortran's is not (1.408).

### 6.1 Test architecture: commit Fortran outputs as golden files

The extension builds only where gfortran and the sources are present, but parity tests must
run in CI on Linux. Resolve that by **capturing Fortran output once and committing it**:

```
tools/gen_fortran_golden.py          # runs emafitpr, writes golden JSON (dev machine only)
tests/fortran_parity/
├── conftest.py                      # pytest.importorskip on the extension
├── golden/
│   ├── big_sandy_03606500.json
│   ├── wymt_<site>.json
│   └── hu02_<site>.json
├── test_native_vs_golden.py         # runs everywhere, incl. CI
└── test_live_vs_golden.py           # dev machine only; catches golden-file drift
```

Each golden file records the **full** `emafitpr` output for one input set — every field in
the §6 ladder, not just the quantiles — so a failure points at a rung rather than just
saying "the answer is wrong":

```json
{
  "meta": {"site": "03606500", "peakfqr_version": "8.1.0", "generated": "2026-..."},
  "inputs": {"n": 0, "ql": [], "qu": [], "tl": [], "tu": [], "dtype": [],
             "reg_M": 0.0, "reg_M_mse": 0.0, "reg_SD": 0.0, "reg_SD_mse": 0.0,
             "r_G": 0.0, "r_G_mse": 0.0, "gbthrsh0": -99.0, "pq": [], "eps": 0.0,
             "wght_opt_n": 1},
  "outputs": {
    "mgbt":  {"gbval": 0.0, "gbns": 0, "gbnzero": 0, "gbnlow": 0},
    "ema":   {"qlema": [], "quema": [], "tlema": [], "tuema": [], "nu": []},
    "cmoms": [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]],
    "skew":  {"as_G_mse_o": 0.0, "as_G_mse_Syst_o": 0.0, "as_G_PRL_o": 0.0, "Wdout": 0.0},
    "quantiles": {"yp": [], "var_est": [], "ci_low": [], "ci_high": []}
  }
}
```

Design rules that make this pay off:

- **Store log10 space, exactly as Fortran returns it.** Convert to real space only in
  assertions. Round-tripping through `10^x` hides small discrepancies — precisely the ones
  being hunted.
- **Record inputs beside outputs.** A golden file whose inputs are implicit is unfalsifiable
  and cannot be regenerated.
- **Assert per rung, tightest first** — `gbval` and the counts exactly, `cmoms` at ~1e-9,
  `yp` at the existing 1 % / 2 % tolerances. A test that only checks Q100 tells you the
  answer is wrong; a laddered test tells you *where*.
- **Pin `peakfqr_version` in `meta`** and fail loudly if the live rebuild disagrees, so a
  future upstream bump cannot silently invalidate the goldens.
- Mark the live tests with the existing `requires_peakfqsa` marker (or add
  `requires_fortran`) so `pytest -m "not requires_fortran"` stays green in CI.

### 6.2 Once parity is established

Extend beyond Big Sandy to the multi-site data this upload brings in — `wymt_ffa_2022A`
(WY/MT, PeakFQ 7.4 expected output) and `extra_tests/HU02` (Northeast US, PeakfqSA 7.5.1).
Those cover EMA branches Big Sandy alone does not: historical-period censoring, zero flows,
and each of the three skew-weighting options. Fixtures for all three already exist under
`tests/peakfqsa/fixtures/`; they have simply never had reference data to run against.

---

## 7. Reference

- `TODO.md` §1–3 — `emafitpr` signature, `cmoms` layout, EMA interval conventions, MGBT and
  skew-MSE encodings. Written from the Fortran; use it as the map when reading `emafit.f`.
- `TODO.md` §4 "Confidence Interval Method" and the `as_G_PRL_o` row of the output table —
  the two paragraphs that describe what is missing from `compute_confidence_limits()`.
- `TODO.md` "Open Questions", last entry — the previous session's own statement of what it
  needed and why it stopped. This document is the answer to that entry.
- `build_fortran/_emafort.pyf` — the f2py signature, derived from `R/fortranWrappers.R`.
  If `emafit.f` disagrees with it, the `.pyf` is wrong and the bridge is silently mis-marshalling.
- `AGENT_BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS_Claude.md` — the original build brief that produced this whole
  subsystem: the origin of `TODO.md`, of the Big Sandy fixture (verbatim in its Step 4), and
  of the `requires_peakfqsa` marker (Step 7). Currently **untracked** — worth committing, as
  it is the only record of why the code is shaped the way it is. Read its Step 0a before
  deciding what else from peakfqr is worth vendoring. Note two of its house rules still in
  force: commit messages reference their step number, and failing tests are not to be
  `xfail`-ed without explicit user approval (the two Big Sandy CI cases were marked with it).
- `CLAUDE.md` — repository conventions, including that all Fortran-facing data is log10
  base-10. Stale in one respect: it describes a `src/flowfreq/` layout that does not exist
  (the package is `flowfreq/`), inherited from the build brief's assumed structure.
