# Repository Split Plan

Splitting `pinhead001/hydrolib` into a reusable analysis library and a separate
Streamlit application.

## 1. Decisions

| Question | Decision |
|---|---|
| Library repo | `pinhead001/pyhydrolib` |
| Library distribution name | `pyhydrolib` (on PyPI, and in `pip install`) |
| Library **import** name | **stays `hydrolib`** — `from hydrolib.bulletin17c import Bulletin17C` |
| App repo | new repo, separate from both (proposed name: `hydrolib-app`) |
| Git history | preserved in both repos; the original repo is archived, not deleted |
| App → library dependency | pinned git URL, bumped deliberately |
| `app/ffa_runner.py` | split — analysis half moves into the library, formatting stays in the app |

The distribution/import name mismatch is deliberate and has precedent
(`scikit-learn`/`sklearn`, `pillow`/`PIL`). It buys a consistent repo name at zero
churn: no edits to ~25 library modules, 25 test files, the docs, the examples, the
`hydrolib` console script, or `.bumpversion.cfg`.

## 2. Why the split is cheap

The coupling is already one-way and shallow. `app/` imports the library; nothing in
`hydrolib/` imports `app`. The only library module that even mentions Streamlit is
`hydrolib/freq_plot.py`, and that is a docstring and a function name — it imports
matplotlib and returns a `Figure`, not a Streamlit call.

Four real boundary defects have to be fixed as part of the split. They are listed in
§4; none is large, but each one silently breaks a split repo if it is skipped.

## 3. File allocation

### → `pyhydrolib` (library)

```
hydrolib/                 all 25 modules, unchanged imports
  peakfqr/                f2py bridge (built, gitignored)
  validation/             comparison engine, benchmarks, reports, reference loaders
  workflow.py             NEW — see §4.1
  data/gage_attributes.csv   MOVED from top-level data/ — see §4.2
vendor/peakfqr/           USGS peakfq 8.1.0 reference (7.2 MB, do not edit)
build_fortran/            build.py + _emafort.pyf
tools/gen_fortran_golden.py
tests/                    everything except the three app test modules
  fixtures/               all 9 fixture modules
  fortran_parity/         parity suite + golden files
  validation/, integration/
  test_workflow.py        NEW — the run_ffa half of test_ffa_runner.py
examples/                 notebooks, scripts, user guide PDF
docs/FORTRAN_UPLOAD.md, vignette_cli.md, vignette_jupyter.md,
     vignette_lowflow_regime.md
.gitattributes            Fortran column-sensitivity rules — load-bearing here
AGENT_BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS_Claude.md, CHANGELOG.md, TODO.md, PRODUCTION.md
```

### → `hydrolib-app` (application)

```
app/streamlit_app.py      minus the sys.path hack (§4.3)
app/ffa_export.py         unchanged
app/ffa_runner.py         formatting/display half only (§4.1)
app/requirements.txt      rewritten (§4.4)
tests/test_streamlit_app.py
tests/test_ffa_export.py
tests/test_ffa_runner.py  formatter tests only
tests/fixtures/big_sandy.py   COPIED — 74 lines of static gage data (§4.5)
docs/vignette_streamlit_local.md, vignette_streamlit_web.md
```

### Archived with the original repo

Nothing is lost — `pinhead001/hydrolib` stays readable as the pre-split record.

## 4. Boundary work

### 4.1 Split `app/ffa_runner.py`

423 lines mixing Bulletin 17C computation with pandas display formatting. The
computation half is exactly what a second consumer would otherwise have to
reimplement, so it belongs in the library.

**Down into `hydrolib/workflow.py`:**

| Symbol | Note |
|---|---|
| `run_ffa()` | wraps `Bulletin17C`; the high-level entry point |
| `_low_outlier_source()` | helper for the above |
| `_B17C_DEFAULT_SKEW` / `B17C_DEFAULT_SKEW` | −0.302, England et al. 2019 |
| `DISPLAY_RETURN_INTERVALS`, `DISPLAY_AEP` | rename to `DEFAULT_*` — no longer display-specific |
| `_skew_values_from_result()` | pure extraction |
| `compute_skew_tables()` | computes quantiles + CIs per skew option |
| `build_skew_curves_dict()` | feeds `hydrolib.freq_plot`, which is already in the library |
| `SKEW_OPTIONS` | the label vocabulary both halves key on |

**Stays in `app/ffa_runner.py`:**
`format_parameters_df()`, `format_quantile_df()`, `build_station_summary_df()` — all
three exist to produce f-string-formatted DataFrames for `st.dataframe`, and bake in
column labels and decimal places that a library should not dictate.

`compute_skew_tables()` is the one judgement call: it returns
`Dict[str, pd.DataFrame]` keyed by display label. It moves because the DataFrame
holds computed numbers, not formatted strings — the formatting pass is a separate
function that stays up.

Re-export the moved names from `hydrolib/__init__.py` and add `workflow` to the
module list in that docstring.

**Do this refactor before the fork**, in the current repo. Then the split itself is a
pure file move, both new repos inherit the clean boundary, and the refactor is
verifiable against the existing test suite in one place.

### 4.2 Fix the `data/` packaging escape

`pyproject.toml` currently ships the CSV with:

```toml
"hydrolib" = ["../data/*.csv", "py.typed"]
```

A `..` in `package-data` reaches outside the package directory. It works with the
current setuptools but is not contractual, and it is why `data*` also has to appear in
`packages.find.include`. Move the file to `hydrolib/data/gage_attributes.csv` and drop
both hacks. `hydrolib/usgs.py:73-81` already searches
`Path(__file__).parent / "data"` as one of three candidate locations, so the move
needs no code change — only the removal of the now-dead sibling paths.

### 4.3 Drop the `sys.path` hacks

Three of them exist only because `app/` and `hydrolib/` share a checkout:

- `app/streamlit_app.py:23` — `sys.path.insert(0, parent)`, commented "needed for Streamlit Cloud"
- `tests/test_ffa_runner.py:11`
- `tests/test_ffa_export.py:13`

Once `pyhydrolib` is a declared pip dependency, all three are wrong rather than
merely ugly: they would shadow the installed package with whatever happens to sit
beside the app. Delete them.

### 4.4 App `requirements.txt`

```
streamlit>=1.28.0
pyhydrolib @ git+https://github.com/pinhead001/pyhydrolib@v0.3.0
numpy>=1.20.0
pandas>=1.3.0
matplotlib>=3.4.0
scipy>=1.7.0
```

`numpy`/`pandas`/`matplotlib`/`scipy` stay declared because `streamlit_app.py`
imports all four directly — a direct import should not rely on a transitive
dependency. `requests` is dropped; only the library's NWIS client uses it.

Streamlit Cloud installs git dependencies from `requirements.txt` without extra
configuration, so no `packages.txt` or secrets are needed. The pin is a tag, so a
library change cannot reach the deployed app until the pin is bumped.

### 4.5 Test fixtures across the boundary

`tests/test_streamlit_app.py:95` and `tests/test_ffa_runner.py` both import
`tests.fixtures.big_sandy`. That module is 74 lines of static USGS 03606500 peak data
and published expectations — copy it into the app repo's own `tests/fixtures/`.

Duplicating it is correct rather than lazy: it is historical gage data that cannot
drift, and the alternative is promoting a test fixture to public library API purely to
serve a downstream test. `tests/test_ffa_export.py` builds its own mock and needs
nothing.

### 4.6 CI, Makefile, lint scope

**`pyhydrolib`** keeps `.github/workflows/tests.yml` with the `app` job deleted, and
`Makefile` with `app/` removed from `PKGS` and the `smoke` target dropped. The
`lint`, `test` (3.9–3.12 matrix), and `fortran` jobs are unchanged — including the
deliberate non-chaining of `lint` and `test` documented in that workflow.

**`hydrolib-app`** gets a single-job workflow on Python 3.12: install
`requirements.txt`, `black --check`, `isort --check-only`, then run the three test
modules. `requires-python = ">=3.10"` — Streamlit's floor, which is why the app job is
separate from the matrix today.

The app repo needs no `pyproject.toml` for packaging (it is a deployed script, not a
distribution), but one is still worth adding to hold the `black`/`isort` config so the
line-length-100 and `profile = "black"` settings do not drift between repos.

### 4.7 Versioning

- `pyhydrolib` starts at **0.3.0** — a new distribution name and a changed public
  surface (`hydrolib.workflow`) both warrant the minor bump. Keep `.bumpversion.cfg`;
  it already drives `pyproject.toml` and `hydrolib/__init__.py`.
- `hydrolib-app` starts at **0.1.0** with its own independent version. It has no
  `.bumpversion.cfg` to inherit — the app's version is a display string, not a
  release contract.
- The library must **tag** releases from now on, because the app pins a tag. A PyPI
  release workflow (PRODUCTION.md §"Release Process") is not required for the git-URL
  pin and can follow later.

### 4.8 Optional: rename `plot_frequency_curve_streamlit`

`hydrolib/freq_plot.py` is named for a consumer it no longer lives with. It imports no
Streamlit and returns a plain matplotlib `Figure`. Renaming the function to
`plot_frequency_curve` (keeping the old name as an alias) and rewording the module
docstring costs one commit and removes a misleading signpost for the next consumer.
Not required for the split to work — sequence it after.

## 5. Execution sequence

### Phase 0 — Refactor in place (current repo) — **DONE**

1. Create `hydrolib/workflow.py`; move the §4.1 symbols; re-export from `__init__.py`.
2. Reduce `app/ffa_runner.py` to the formatters; update its imports.
3. Split `tests/test_ffa_runner.py` → `tests/test_workflow.py` (library) + a slimmed
   `tests/test_ffa_runner.py` (formatters).
4. Move `data/gage_attributes.csv` → `hydrolib/data/`; fix `pyproject.toml` and prune
   the dead search paths in `usgs.py`.
5. `make check && make smoke` — both green before anything is forked.

Phase 0 lands as a normal PR on `main`. It is independently valuable even if the split
stalls. Done in `abfe9fb`: 502 passed, 5 xfailed, lint clean, and the packaged gage
table verified from a clean venv install.

Two items in §4 are deliberately **not** in Phase 0 and remain for the repo split:

- The three `sys.path.insert` calls (§4.3). They are harmless while both trees share a
  checkout, and `app/` moves to its own repo root in Phase 2 where the import situation
  is different — removing them now would be a change made against conditions that are
  about to stop applying.
- `plot_frequency_curve_streamlit` (§4.8), which is a rename, not a boundary fix.

### Phase 1 — Create `pyhydrolib`

GitHub does not allow forking a personal repo into the account that owns it, so the
history-preserving move is a clone-and-push, not the Fork button:

```bash
gh repo create pinhead001/pyhydrolib --public
git clone https://github.com/pinhead001/hydrolib pyhydrolib && cd pyhydrolib
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/pinhead001/pyhydrolib
git push -u origin main            # full history, all 107 commits

git rm -r app tests/test_streamlit_app.py tests/test_ffa_export.py \
          tests/test_ffa_runner.py docs/vignette_streamlit_*.md
# pyproject: name = "pyhydrolib", version 0.3.0
# Makefile: drop app/ from PKGS, drop the smoke target
# workflow: delete the app job
# README/CLAUDE.md: rewrite for a library-only repo
git commit && git push
git tag v0.3.0 && git push --tags
```

### Phase 2 — Create `hydrolib-app`

Same clone-and-push, then the inverse deletion:

```bash
gh repo create pinhead001/hydrolib-app --public
# clone, repoint origin, push main
git rm -r hydrolib vendor build_fortran tools examples \
          tests/fortran_parity tests/validation tests/integration \
          docs/FORTRAN_UPLOAD.md docs/vignette_cli.md \
          docs/vignette_jupyter.md docs/vignette_lowflow_regime.md \
          .bumpversion.cfg AGENT_BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS_Claude.md
git rm $(ls tests/test_*.py | grep -v 'ffa_\|streamlit')
git rm tests/fixtures/*.py   # then restore big_sandy.py per §4.5
# write requirements.txt (§4.4), new workflow, new README/CLAUDE.md
```

Keeping the full history here is worth the clone even though only 21 commits touch
`app/` — `git log --follow` on the app files still resolves, and the deletion commit
is a legible marker of where the split happened.

### Phase 3 — Wire and verify

1. Push `pyhydrolib` and tag `v0.3.0` **before** the app's `requirements.txt` pin can
   resolve.
2. In a clean venv: `pip install -r requirements.txt && make smoke` in the app repo.
3. Repoint the Streamlit Cloud deployment at `pinhead001/hydrolib-app`, main branch,
   `app/streamlit_app.py`. Confirm the deployed app loads and runs one gage.

### Phase 4 — Archive

Archive `pinhead001/hydrolib` (Settings → Archive) once both repos are green and the
deployment is live. Add a one-line README note in each new repo pointing back to it.

## 6. Verification gates

| Gate | Command | Must show |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 0 | `make check` | full suite green, one known `xfail` on Cains Coulee |
| Phase 0 | `make smoke` | app imports and runs against the refactored boundary |
| pyhydrolib | `PYTHONSAFEPATH=1 python -m pytest tests/` | green on 3.9 and 3.12 |
| pyhydrolib | `grep -rn "app\." hydrolib/ tests/` | no hits |
| pyhydrolib | `make parity` | extension builds, golden files match |
| pyhydrolib | `pip install . && python -c "from hydrolib.usgs import USGSgage; USGSgage"` | packaged CSV resolves from the installed location |
| hydrolib-app | `pip install -r requirements.txt` in a clean venv | pinned tag resolves |
| hydrolib-app | `grep -rn "sys.path" app/ tests/` | no hits |
| hydrolib-app | `make smoke` | app imports against the *installed* library |
| Deployment | Streamlit Cloud | one gage analysed end to end |

The packaged-CSV check matters because it is the one failure the test suite cannot
catch from a source checkout: `usgs.py` finds the file via a sibling path that only
disappears once the package is installed elsewhere.

## 7. Risks

**Streamlit Cloud repoint.** The deployment currently tracks
`pinhead001/hydrolib`; archiving that repo without repointing first takes the app
down. Phase 3 step 3 precedes Phase 4 for this reason.

**Fortran toolchain.** Only `pyhydrolib` needs gfortran + meson, and only in the
`fortran` CI job. The app repo requires no compiler — worth stating in its README,
since the vendored Fortran is the loudest thing in the current repo and its absence
will read as an omission.

**The `hydrolib` name on PyPI.** `pyhydrolib` is the distribution name, so nothing is
claimed under `hydrolib`. Anyone who previously installed this repo from a git URL as
`hydrolib` keeps working — the import name is unchanged — but their pin needs updating
to the new repo URL. Note it in the pyhydrolib CHANGELOG.

**Doc drift.** `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `TODO.md` (71 KB) and `PRODUCTION.md` all
describe a combined repo. `CLAUDE.md` in particular is instructions to an agent and
will actively mislead if it still claims `app/` is present. Rewriting the first two is
Phase 1/2 work, not follow-up; `TODO.md` and `PRODUCTION.md` can be pruned afterwards.
