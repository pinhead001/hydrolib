# TODO — HydroLib Hybrid 17C Implementation

## Status
Last updated: 2026-08-31
Tests: **497 passed, 1 deselected, 7 xfailed** in ~62 s (was ~75 s for far fewer tests; see
the MGBT memoization below). CI green on main. Two of the seven xfails are new, both on the
Cains Coulee parity case; see P3.
Fortran reference: **vendored** at `vendor/peakfqr/` (peakfq 8.1.0, CC0).
Fortran bridge: builds from those sources via `python build_fortran/build.py`
(gfortran + meson) and is now **built and checked in CI** by `make parity`.

Every P1 and P2 item is done. What is left is P3: two numerical defects that turn out to be
the same missing machinery, specified precisely below.

---

## Open Items (prioritised)

### P3 — The open numerical defects

Both are `xfail(strict=True)` in `tests/fortran_parity/test_native_vs_golden.py`, so the build
fails the moment either starts passing. Nothing else is blocked on them.

They are **not two problems**. Both bottom out in `var_mom` and its dependency tree, which is
the one piece of the reference implementation that has never been ported. Read this section
as one item with two symptoms.

**The defect is censoring-specific, and that is now measured rather than assumed.** Two
Wyoming/Montana parity cases were added for exactly this question:

| case | censoring | reference `Wd` | native vs peakfq 8.1.0 |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Powder River 06326500 | none | 1.0 | mean **0.0**, sd **3.7e-14**, at-site skew **4.5e-12**, weighted skew **7.5e-11**; quantiles ≤ 0.10% |
| Cains Coulee 06327450 | 11 PILFs from MGBT | **0.184** | at-site skew 0.122, weighted skew 0.098; quantiles 0.30% to 18.7%, 2.7% at Q100 |

So with nothing censored the native EMA reproduces peakfq to machine precision — the in-loop
regional-skew weighting is *right*, not merely closer. Everything that remains is
censored-path work. Cains Coulee is also the first case in the repository where `detrat`
actually bites, so it is the oracle for that routine.

- [ ] **Port `var_mom` and the routines it needs.** ~1,100 lines of Fortran in `emafit.f`
      alone, plus `CHOL33` (`probfun.f`), `DLGINV` (`imslfake.f`), and `expmomderiv`, `m2mn`,
      `m2p`, `fp_tnc_icdf` which live outside `emafit.f`. The tree:

      ```
      mseg_all(ADJE)  -> mse_ema -> var_mom -> mP3(k=6), pP3, varb, varc,
                                               d_est -> m2p, qP3, expmomderiv
                                    m2mn
                                    mn2mvarb -> mn2m_var, mc2mnvb, jmc2mnvb,
                                                chol33, dlginv   (iterative solver)
      VAR_EMAB        -> regmoms, gridmake (the inverse-Cholesky quadrature),
                         ci_ema_m3b
      ```

      Sizes, for planning: `var_mom` 111, `mP3` 141, `regmoms` 111, `gridmake` 93,
      `mn2mvarb` 77, `qP3` 73, `VAR_EMAB` 66, `jmc2mnvb` 61, `mc2mnvb` 58, `mseg_all` 57,
      `pP3` 54, `ci_ema_m3b` 51, `mse_ema` 49, `d_est` 39, `varb`/`varc` 23 each.

      **Verify per routine, not end to end.** `build_fortran/_emafort.pyf` now exposes
      `mseg_all_sub`, `detratsub`, `var_mom` and `moms_p3` alongside `emafitpr`, and
      `tests/fortran_parity/test_fortran_oracles.py` pins what each says. Checking a ported
      routine only through `emafitpr` means checking it through a fixed point with a
      condition number around 1e13, where a correct routine can look wrong and a wrong one
      can look right. All four were already externally callable — peakfqr's own R code calls
      them via `.Fortran()`, and `vendor/peakfqr/R/fortranWrappers.R` documents the
      conventions — so no new Fortran was needed.

      Two usage notes that cost time to find:

      * `detrat` takes the **post-MGBT** thresholds. Cains Coulee's input thresholds are
        uncensored throughout, so calling it with those returns 1.0; MGBT raises the lower
        threshold to log10(332) = 2.521 inside the fit, and only then does it give the 0.184
        `emafitpr` reports. Those arrays come back as `tlema`/`tuema`.
      * Group thresholds on **exact** values. Rounding to 12 decimals to be "robust" moves
        Big Sandy's at-site skew MSE by 2.2e-4.

      What the oracles found immediately, both now covered by tests:

      * `_ema_iteration` reproduces `moms_p3` **exactly** on uncensored rows (0.0 on the
        mean, ~1e-14 variance, ~1e-12 skew) and diverges only where intervals are censored
        (Cains Coulee: 0.70% variance, 4.94% skew). So the transcribed formulas are right
        and the residual is in the truncated-P3 moment code for censored intervals — that is
        what the port has to replace, and it is a smaller target than "the EMA is off".
      * `_b17b_skew_mse` is exact against `mseg()` up to n = 150 and **31% high at n = 200**
        (0.0479 against 0.0365). `mseg_all` evaluates `mseg()` at `min(n, 150)` then lets
        ADJE's bias adjustment partially undo the cap; hydrolib applies the cap alone. On a
        record longer than 150 years that over-weights the regional skew. No parity case is
        that long, so only the oracle test detects it, and fixing it needs `mse_ema`.

- [ ] **Skew weighting — 24% left, and it is all `as_G_mse`.** The structural half is done
      (see below): the regional skew is now folded into the EMA fixed point as `moms_p3`
      does it, which took Big Sandy from 35% to **24.1%** (−0.1187 against peakfq's −0.1563)
      and improved the mean and variance at the same time.

      All of the remainder is one input. peakfq's default `at_site_option` is `ADJE`
      (`emafit.f:3888`): `as_G_mse = bias_adj * mseg(min(n,150), G)`, where `bias_adj` is the
      censoring inflation `mse_ema(censored)/mse_ema(uncensored)` — **1.4844** on Big Sandy.
      Only `mseg()` is implemented (`_b17b_skew_mse`), so a censored record under-weights the
      regional skew. Feeding peakfq's own `as_G_mse` (0.09437) through this code gives
      **−0.1592 against −0.1563, a 1.9% gap**, which is inside the xfail's 0.02 bound. So the
      structure is right and the input is not.

      Also unimplemented: `detrat`, the Halloween determinant ratio. `emafit.f:763` applies it
      only when the at-site skew is ≥ 0.04 in magnitude, and Big Sandy's is 0.0066, so `Wd`
      is 1 there either way. **Cains Coulee 06327450 now covers it**: its at-site skew is
      −0.708 and its reference `Wd` is **0.184**, so hydrolib's implicit 1 over-weights the
      regional skew by more than fivefold on that site. That case is the acceptance test for
      `detrat`, and its two `xfail(strict=True)` assertions will fail the build the moment
      the routine lands and starts working.

- [ ] **Confidence-interval shape.** `compute_confidence_limits()` forms `log_Q ± z·se`,
      symmetric by construction (ratio 1.000 at every AEP). peakfq skews right with return
      period — 1.03 → 1.31 → 1.41 at AEP 0.1 / 0.02 / 0.01. **Shape, not size**: total width
      is within ~2% and point estimates within 0.5%, so the variance magnitude is essentially
      right and `var_mom`'s output is not the suspect — its absence is.

      The formula is no longer a mystery. `ci_ema_m3b` (`emafit.f:1853`) is short and fully
      readable:

      ```
      beta1     = cov(yp, syp) / var(yp)            # regression of the s.e. on the quantile
      var_xsi_d = var(syp) - cov(yp, syp)**2/var(yp)
      nu        = max(5, 0.5 * var(yp)/var_xsi_d)   # Student t degrees of freedom
      t         = t_nu((1 + eps)/2)
      ci_high   = yp + sqrt(var(yp)) *  t / max(0.5, 1 - beta1*t)
      ci_low    = yp + sqrt(var(yp)) * -t / max(0.5, 1 + beta1*t)
      ```

      The whole asymmetry is the `1 - beta1*t` denominator: it shrinks on the high side and
      grows on the low side. Implementing this is an afternoon. Getting `beta1` is not —
      `cov(yp, syp)` comes from `VAR_EMAB`, hence from `var_mom`. Implementing `ci_ema_m3b`
      alone with `beta1 = 0` reproduces exactly today's symmetric interval, so there is no
      partial credit available here: the port comes first.

      The pseudo effective record length (`as_G_PRL_o`, 54.373 for Big Sandy) is
      `eff_n * as_G_mse_Syst / as_G_mse` (`emafit.f:758`) — two more `mseg_all` calls, so it
      is blocked on the same port.

### Follow-ups found while clearing P1 and P2

Small, specified, none blocking. (The second-parity-case item that used to head this list is
done — see the P3 table above and the Done section.)

- [ ] **`plot_peak_flows_with_thresholds` is still uncalled.** `app/streamlit_app.py` has its
      own `plot_peak_timeseries`, which carries return-period lines and the max-peak
      recurrence annotation that the library function does not; switching to the library one
      today would lose features. The dedupe is: move those two features into
      `hydrolib/freq_plot.py`, then delete the app copy. One peak-flow plotter, tested.

- [ ] **`print()` in `hydrolib/__init__.py`.** `complete_analysis()` prints progress to stdout,
      which `CLAUDE.md` forbids in library code. Six calls. Swapping them for
      `logging.getLogger(__name__)` changes what a caller sees, so it is a small behavioural
      change rather than a pure cleanup — hence listed, not done in passing.

- [ ] **The mypy ratchet: six modules, 155 errors.** `__init__` (7), `bulletin17c` (62),
      `freq_plot` (19), `hydrograph` (18), `lowflow` (19), `report` (30) are excluded in
      `pyproject.toml`'s `[[tool.mypy.overrides]]`. The other fourteen modules are gated in
      CI. Fix a module, delete its line; nothing may be added to the list.

- [ ] **Three modules still at 0% coverage**: `cli.py`, `plots.py`,
      `validation/reports.py`. `batch.py` was the fourth, and covering it immediately turned
      up `analyze_sites()` broken for every input — so these are not merely untested, they
      are unverified.

- [ ] **`origin/dev` can be deleted.** The read-and-judge pass is done — see the commit
      "Port extra_curves from dev". `extra_curves` was the one library delta worth keeping
      and is on this branch; `hydrolib/setup.py` is stale packaging that contradicts
      `pyproject.toml`; everything else is superseded or older than main. Tip is `86cb147`,
      recorded here so the branch is recoverable by SHA. Left undeleted deliberately: that is
      not reversible from a commit, so it is the owner's call.

### Blocked

- [ ] **Tag pushes return HTTP 403** from the agent environment, so neither `v0.2.0` nor an
      `archive/dev-2026-02` tag could be pushed. Needs tag-push permission, or someone
      pushing tags from a local clone.

---

## Done

### Release, coverage and contributor infrastructure

- [x] **mypy in CI**, gating fourteen of twenty modules with six on a documented ratchet.
      Its first run found 172 errors, four of them real defects in shipped code: implicit
      `Optional` on `Bulletin17C(historical_peaks=, perception_thresholds=)` and on both
      dates of `USGSgage.download_daily_flow()`, and two `-> "pd.DataFrame"` annotations
      naming a module that was never imported. `mypy` and `types-requests` went into the dev
      extra so the job and `make typecheck` cannot resolve different versions.

- [x] **`analyze_sites()` was broken for every input, and coverage is how it surfaced.**
      `fetch_nwis_batch` returns plain dicts; `B17CEngine.fit` reads `record.flow`;
      `run_multi_site`'s `except Exception` turned the `AttributeError` into
      `{"error": "'dict' object has no attribute 'flow'"}` for every site, silently. Nothing
      in `hydrolib/batch.py` was covered, so nothing executed it. Fixed by converting at the
      boundary; `tests/test_batch.py` is the first test file the module has had, and pins
      both the conversion and the fact that going through the fetch path does not change the
      fitted numbers.

- [x] **Coverage gate at 66%.** Measured 67.87%, up from 65% once `batch.py` went 0% → 100%
      and `engine.py` 0% → 68%. Not the 80% `PRODUCTION.md` proposed: 80% fails on the first
      run, and a floor above the floor is not a ratchet, it is a broken build. Verified in
      both directions — the gate passes at 66 and fails non-zero at 70. Its own CI job rather
      than the 3.9–3.12 matrix, because four interpreters give four slightly different
      numbers and no authority about which is real.

- [x] **`release.yml`**, tag-driven, with the two gates that matter running before anything
      is published: the tag, `pyproject.toml` and `.bumpversion.cfg` must agree on the
      version — exactly the drift that left `bump2version` unusable — and the built wheel
      must contain `py.typed` and the packaged benchmark data, both of which have gone
      missing before. PyPI publishing is opt-in behind a `PUBLISH_TO_PYPI` variable and
      trusted publishing, so a tag push cannot publish by accident. **Unverified end to
      end**: tag pushes return 403 here (see Blocked). Verified locally instead — the guard
      accepts `v0.2.0` and rejects `v0.3.0`, `python -m build` produces both artifacts,
      `twine check` passes, and the wheel assertion passes on the real wheel.

- [x] **`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.github/dependabot.yml`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.** The
      pre-commit revs match the dev extra's pins, because installing different versions is
      how CI lint went red in August 2026; mypy runs there as a `local` hook against the
      developer's own environment rather than an isolated one that would disagree with CI.
      `pre-commit run --all-files` has **not** been executed here — the hook repos need
      network fetches the sandbox does not make — so the config parses but is otherwise
      unproven.

### P1 — Reduce time to verify and commit

- [x] **One-command verify.** The default selection lives in `pyproject.toml`'s `addopts`, so
      a bare `pytest` is the CI selection on every platform. Override from the CLI when you
      want the excluded tests (`-m ""` for everything). `make check` / `make help` still
      exist; CI runs plain `pytest tests/`.

- [x] **Un-gate the test job from lint.** ~~`needs: lint`~~ removed; the jobs are
      independent, and `fail-fast: false` means all four matrix jobs report.

- [x] **Memoize `_mgbt_pvalue`.** Measured first, because the obvious assumption is wrong:
      within one analysis all 22 keys are distinct, so an `lru_cache` buys **0%** for a
      user-facing run. It pays only where the same fit repeats — 66 calls over 22 distinct
      keys across three identical analyses, 67% — which is the suite's access pattern.
      Measured after, rather than assumed: **75.4 s → 13.6 s**, two runs each way, identical
      outcomes, and refitting with the cache bypassed gives bit-identical results (max |diff|
      0.0). Bigger than this entry originally estimated, because the suite shares fixtures
      more heavily than the three-analysis probe suggested. Decorator order is load-bearing
      and now has a test: `staticmethod` outermost, or Python 3.9 breaks and 3.11 does not.

- [x] **Build the Fortran in one CI job.** New `fortran` job runs `make parity`: build,
      assert the extension imports, then run `tests/fortran_parity/`. The import assertion is
      the point — the parity tests call `importorskip`, so without it a failed build would
      skip all twelve live-vs-golden tests and report green. Verified on Linux/CPython 3.11:
      the extension builds from the vendored sources and the committed goldens are not
      drifted.

- [x] **Lint and smoke-test `app/`.** `app/` joined `PKGS`, so the existing lint job covers it
      (it was already clean). `tests/test_streamlit_app.py` imports `app/streamlit_app.py`,
      which is a top-level script, so importing it executes the whole body in Streamlit's bare
      mode — widgets return defaults, `download_data` is False, nothing contacts NWIS.
      Confirmed non-vacuous: a `NameError` in an executed branch turns all 13 tests red. Runs
      in its own `app` job because Streamlit needs Python ≥ 3.10 and the matrix still covers
      3.9.

### P2 — Cleanup that stops the same confusion recurring

- [x] **Reviewed `dev`'s remaining library deltas.** See the follow-up above for the branch
      itself.

- [x] **Removed the 5.2 MB of Windows binaries** in `hydrolib/peakfqr/`. `.gitignore` now also
      excludes `hydrolib/peakfqr/*.dll`, and the Streamlit vignette no longer tells readers
      the repository ships a prebuilt extension.

- [x] **Decided what `hydrolib/peakfqsa/` is for: nothing.** Deleted — `config.py`,
      `wrapper.py`, `io_converters.py`, `validators.py` (imported by nothing at all) and the
      `.out` parser, with their ~50 mock tests and the dead `requires_peakfqsa` marker. The
      result container survives as `hydrolib/validation/reference.py::ReferenceResult`,
      pointed at references that exist: `from_golden()` reads the committed golden file,
      `from_emafit()` calls the vendored Fortran live. They agree bitwise on Big Sandy.
      `tests/peakfqsa/fixtures/` was never about the binary — it merged into the existing
      `tests/fixtures/`, and that move silently broke `paths.py`'s hardcoded `parents[3]`
      (three passing tests would have skipped rather than failed), now anchored on
      `pyproject.toml`.

- [x] **Wired the PILF override into the Streamlit UI.** Sidebar control, both `run_ffa` call
      sites, and the refit trigger. Peaks below the applied cut are drawn hollow under a red
      threshold line, so the control changes something a user can see.

### Found and fixed while clearing the above

- [x] **`hydrolib benchmark` could not work for an installed user.** Three defects, all
      pre-existing: it imported fixture data from `tests/`, which is not packaged, so the
      command raised `ModuleNotFoundError` outside a source checkout; two of its three
      registered benchmarks carried no peaks at all and errored on every run; and the third
      validated against the 2012 PeakfqSA manual, which peakfq 8.1.0 does not reproduce, so a
      correct implementation was guaranteed a FAIL. Case data now ships in
      `hydrolib/validation/data/`, tolerances are measured, and known deviations are reported
      rather than compared. 1/1 passed, from any directory.

- [x] **`Benchmark.run_native()` dropped the perception thresholds**, comparing a
      systematic-only fit against the reference's censored one and calling the modelling
      difference an error.

### Per-routine oracles for the port

- [x] **Extended `_emafort.pyf`** with `mseg_all_sub`, `detratsub`, `var_mom` and `moms_p3`.
      The signature file is still not merely a filter — without it f2py tries to wrap
      QUADPACK's `dqag` and the build fails in generated C — so each symbol is listed
      deliberately. `mseg_all_sub` reproduces `emafitpr`'s `as_G_mse_o` exactly on all three
      parity cases, which makes it the oracle the ADJE work is written against; `detratsub`
      reproduces `Wdout` to 1e-9 given the post-MGBT thresholds. See the P3 entry for the
      two defects this immediately surfaced.

### Parity beyond Big Sandy

- [x] **Two Wyoming/Montana parity cases**, from peaks the repository already vendored
      (`wymt_ffa_2022A_EMPdata_7_4.csv`). Both are contiguous systematic records with no
      historic peaks and no zero flows, so their EMA inputs are unambiguous. Powder River
      (85 years, no PILFs) and Cains Coulee (32 years, 11 PILFs under MGBT). Registered in
      `CASES`, goldens generated from the vendored 8.1.0 Fortran; the peakfq 7.4 numbers in
      those CSVs are a cross-check only, never a parity target.

      `test_live_vs_golden.py` is now parametrised over every registered case rather than
      Big Sandy alone, which is what says whether its tolerances generalise. They do, with
      room: the 1-ulp conditioning response is **0.0** on Powder River and ~1e-13 on Cains
      Coulee, against Big Sandy's 1e-5 to 1e-4. Censoring drives the conditioning, not record
      length — Big Sandy's 37 censored intervals are why it is the ill-conditioned one, and
      the tolerances calibrated on it are the loosest any case needs. Minimum headroom across
      all three: 10.7x.

      Both new modules skip cleanly when the reference tree is absent — verified by hiding
      `vendor/peakfqr/inst/testdata` and re-running: 406 passed, 44 skipped, exit 0. The
      `requires_peakfqr_testdata` marker alone does not skip anything, so it is paired with
      a `skipif` on `TESTDATA_AVAILABLE`, the same way `tests/test_r_fixtures.py` does it.

### The structural half of the skew defect

- [x] **The regional skew is weighted inside the EMA fixed point.** peakfq does not average
      two skews after fitting — the explicit average is commented out at `emafit.f:1259`, and
      `moms_p3` folds the regional skew in as `nG` pseudo-observations every iteration, where
      it also moves the mean and variance. Two bugs fixed: the bias corrections `c2`/`c3`
      apply to exact peaks only, not to censored intervals' expected moments; and the
      weighting belongs in the loop, not after it. Big Sandy, against the golden file:

      | | before | after | peakfq 8.1.0 |
      |---|---:|---:|---:|
      | `mean_log` | 0.05% | **0.01%** | 3.717508 |
      | `std_log` | 1.72% | **0.63%** | 0.291043 |
      | at-site skew | 0.0165 abs | **0.0046** | 0.006601 |
      | weighted skew | 35.4% | **24.1%** | −0.156306 |
      | Q100 | — | **0.88%** | 22 959.4 |

---

The 16 phases below were completed in February against the assumption that PeakfqSA was
a standalone binary. It is not, and `hydrolib/peakfqsa/` wraps an executable that does
not exist. Kept for the record; see `AGENT_BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS_Claude.md`.

### 2. EMA Parameter Conventions

**Flow intervals** (ql, qu):
- Exact observation: `ql[i] = qu[i] = log10(Q)`
- Less-than (censored): `ql[i] = log10(Qmin)` (~-20), `qu[i] = log10(threshold)`
- Greater-than: `ql[i] = log10(Q)`, `qu[i] = log10(Qmax)` (~+20)
- Interval: `ql[i] = log10(lower)`, `qu[i] = log10(upper)`
- Zero flows: enter as `lmissing = -80.0`

**Perception thresholds** (tl, tu):
- Systematic period: `tl = log10(0)` (uses Qmin=1e-20), `tu = log10(1e20)`
- Historical period: `tl = log10(threshold)`, `tu = log10(1e20)`
- Missing data (no info): `tl = log10(1e20)`, `tu = log10(1e20)` (both infinity)

**R wrapper** (`fortranWrappers.R:emafit`):
- Accepts real-space data, converts to log10 before calling Fortran
- pq = 1 - AEPs (converts exceedance prob to non-exceedance)
- Converts output quantiles back: `10^yp`, `10^ci_low`, `10^ci_high`
- Default AEPs: 0.995, 0.99, 0.98, 0.975, 0.96, 0.95, 0.90, 0.80, 0.70, 0.667, 0.60, 0.5704, 0.50, 0.4292, 0.40, 0.30, 0.20, 0.10, 0.05, 0.04, 0.025, 0.02, 0.01, 0.005, 0.002

### 3. MGBT Implementation

**Encoding via `gbthrsh0`:**
- `<= -6`: Run MGBT (default; R passes `-99`)
- `> -6`: Use as fixed threshold (R passes `log10(user_value)`)
- `~-5.9`: Disable low outlier test (R passes `log10(Qmin)`)

**R-side logic** (`fortranWrappers.R` lines 93-128):
- FIXED: `LOthresh >= 1e-6` → set to `log10(LOthresh)`
- NONE: `LOthresh > 1e-99` → set to `log10(Qmin)` (effectively disables)
- MGBT: `LOthresh <= 1e-99` → set to `-99`, validates ≥5 nonzero peaks, checks upper thresholds > median

**MGBT output interpretation:**
- `gbnlow` = number of PILFs detected
- `gbqs[1:nPILFs]` = peak values identified as PILFs
- `gbp[1:nPILFs]` = associated p-values
- PILF threshold = `10^gbval`

### 4. Confidence Interval Method

- Uses **Inverse Modified Cholesky Gaussian Quadrature** (added Oct 2012, emafit.f)
- CI coverage controlled by `eps` parameter (default 0.90 = 90% CI)
- Output: `ci_low` and `ci_high` in log10 space (5th and 95th percentiles for 90% CI)
- Small-sample correction applied: monotonicity enforcement on CI bounds (lines 485-491)
- Variance of estimate (`var_est`) also returned for each quantile
- This matches peakfqr's approach — no differences noted

### 5. Regional Skew Weighting

**r_G_mse encoding (four cases):**
1. `r_G_mse = 0`: Use fixed `g = r_G` with MSE=0 ("Generalized skew, no error")
2. `-98 < r_G_mse < 0`: Use fixed `g = r_G` with MSE = `-r_G_mse` ("Generalized skew, MSE > 0")
3. `0 < r_G_mse < 1e10`: Weighted average of at-site and regional skew ("Weighted")
4. `r_G_mse > 1e10`: Use at-site skew only ("Station")

**R conversion** (`main.R` lines 415-424):
- Station: `SkewMSE = -1e99`
- Weighted: `SkewMSE = SkewSE^2`
- Regional (generalized): `SkewMSE = -(SkewSE^2)` (negative)

**Weighting formula** (Bulletin 17C):
- `skew_weighted = (skew_atsite * MSE_regional + skew_regional * MSE_atsite) / (MSE_regional + MSE_atsite)`
- Halloween method (HWN, default): Applies determinant ratio `Wd` correction for censored data
- `detrat()` computes Wd from EXPMOMCDERIV subroutine
- Wd=1.0 when no censored data present (equivalent to INV method)

### 6. Output Field Mapping

**peakfqr output → PeakfqSAResult mapping:**

| peakfqr field | Source | PeakfqSAResult field |
|--------------|--------|---------------------|
| Mean | cmoms[1,1] | parameters["mean_log"] |
| StandDev | sqrt(cmoms[2,1]) | parameters["std_log"] |
| Skew | cmoms[3,1] | parameters["skew_weighted"] |
| AtSiteMean | cmoms[1,2] | parameters["mean_log_at_site"] |
| AtSiteStandDev | sqrt(cmoms[2,2]) | parameters["std_log_at_site"] |
| AtSiteSkew | cmoms[3,2] | parameters["skew_at_site"] |
| AtSiteMSEG | EMAout[[24]] | parameters["mse_skew"] |
| AtSiteMSEG_GagedOnly | EMAout[[25]] | parameters["mse_skew_systematic"] |
| RegSkew | input rG | parameters["regional_skew"] |
| RegMSEG | input rGmse | parameters["regional_skew_mse"] |
| RecordLength | n | n_peaks |
| HistPeaks | count(dtype==1) | n_historical |
| PILF_Method | derived | low_outlier_method |
| PILF_Thresh | 10^gbval | low_outlier_threshold |
| PILFs | gbnlow | low_outlier_count |
| PILF_0s | gbnzero | (informational) |
| WeightOpt | input | (config) |
| WeightCo (Wd) | EMAout[[32]] | (informational) |
| EXC_Prob | AEPs | quantiles keys |
| Estimate | 10^yp | quantiles values |
| Variance | var_est | (per-quantile) |
| Conf_Low | 10^ci_low | confidence_intervals lower |
| Conf_Up | 10^ci_high | confidence_intervals upper |

### 7. Edge Cases Handled

- **Zero flows**: Enter as `lmissing = -80.0` in log space; counted separately as PILF_0s
- **All values positive required**: R validates `all(QT[,c("ql","qu","tl","tu")] > 0)` before log transform
- **Minimum data**: Requires ≥3 rows for skew calculation; peakfq() requires ≥10 total or ≥8 exact
- **MGBT with few peaks**: Requires >5 non-zero exactly-known peaks
- **Upper threshold < median**: Rejected when using MGBT (causes numerical issues)
- **Censored data with code 4**: Converted to interval `[0, stated_value]`
- **Greater-than peaks (code 8)**: Converted to interval `[stated_value, infinity]`
- **Historic peaks (code 7)**: Set perception thresholds based on lowest historic peak in period
- **Regulated/urbanized (codes 6, C)**: Excluded by default; included if `Urb/Reg = Yes`
- **Dam failure (code 3), Opportunistic (code O)**: Always excluded

## Known Limitations

- **Native EMA with historical data**: The native Python EMA implementation can diverge
  (produce NaN) when processing historical/censored intervals due to numerical instability
  in the quad integration. This is a known limitation of the existing `bulletin17c.py`
  implementation. Systematic-only analyses converge reliably.

- **PeakfqSA binary not available**: The PeakfqSA Fortran executable is not available as
  a standalone binary. The peakfqr R package contains the authoritative Fortran source.
  The wrapper module is implemented and tested via mocks but cannot be used end-to-end
  without a standalone executable.

- **Native EMA confidence intervals** — superseded. The Fortran is now vendored, the
  extension builds, and the question this entry asked has been answered: see the Status
  block above and `docs/FORTRAN_UPLOAD.md` §6.0 and §6.0b. Two findings worth carrying
  forward. First, the residual is interval *shape*, not variance magnitude. Second, the
  2012 PeakfqSA manual values this was measured against are not reproducible by peakfq
  8.1.0 at all, so part of the original discrepancy was never a defect — the fixture now
  carries `PEAKFQ_810_*` values for parity work alongside the 2012 ones.

## Resolved Questions

- PeakfqSA: Not a standalone binary. Use the vendored `vendor/peakfqr/src/` Fortran.
  `hydrolib/peakfqsa/` wraps a binary that does not exist and is mock-tested only.
- Reference material: vendored into `vendor/peakfqr/` (CC0). No external workspace needed.
- Big Sandy 2012 manual values: not reproducible by peakfq 8.1.0 — the HWN skew weighting
  postdates the manual and diverges by design on censored records.
- MGBT: verified line-by-line against the Fortran (`GGBCRITP`/`FP_TNC_CDF`), validated on
  Orestimba Creek (USGS 11274500).
- Python: CI tests 3.9–3.12; `requires-python >= 3.9`.
- Regional skew defaults: -0.302 / MSE 0.3025 (Bulletin 17C national map)
- Git: Commit to dev branch, no push unless asked
- FrequencyAnalyzer API: Added validate() and to_comparison_dict() to Bulletin17C facade
