flowfreq.regime - Flow regime metrics

Intra-annual flow-pattern metrics computed from a daily flow series:
Richards-Baker flashiness, TQmean, baseflow separation and index, and
monthly/seasonal summary statistics -- plus (see the diel-variation
functions further down this module) metrics computed from an instantaneous
series. Grouped together because both describe the *shape* of a flow
record rather than the frequency of its extremes, which is what
flowfreq.bulletin17c and flowfreq.lowflow cover.

Method notes
------------
**Year definition.** Metrics here default to the *water year* (Oct 1 - Sep
30), not the climatic year flowfreq.lowflow uses. The climatic year (Apr 1
- Mar 31) exists specifically to avoid splitting a single connected
low-flow event; flashiness, TQmean, and baseflow index describe a whole
year's hydrograph shape rather than the timing of one extreme, and water
year is both the USGS convention for these indices (e.g. Richards-Baker
flashiness is conventionally reported by water year) and what published
regional statistics use, so it is the more useful default for
comparability. Pass ``year_type="climatic"`` or ``"calendar"`` to use
those instead; see :func:`flowfreq.core.assign_year_label`.

**Completeness.** Every per-year metric in this module uses the same rule:
a year needs at least ``min_days`` valid daily values (negative values
count as missing, matching flowfreq.lowflow) to get a computed value; below
that, the metric is NaN and the row's ``complete`` flag is False rather
than the year disappearing or a value being silently computed from a
partial record. One metric is only approximately exact even in a
"complete" year: the flashiness index sums day-to-day differences, and a
handful of missing days each spoil the (at most two) differences adjacent
to them, which are dropped via ``nansum`` rather than fabricated. With
``min_days=350`` (the default, matching flowfreq.lowflow) this is at most
roughly a dozen dropped difference terms out of ~364, a small but nonzero
approximation worth knowing is there.

**Baseflow separation methods.** Five are implemented, named explicitly
because a BFI value is not comparable across methods without knowing which
one produced it -- every function and results object reports the method
used alongside the number. This is not a minor labeling formality: the
five methods are known in the literature to disagree systematically on
the same site (a step-function method like hysep_fixed and a smoothly
interpolated one like ih_smoothed_minima do not converge as the record
gets longer, they measure recognizably different things), so a BFI
computed here is only comparable to a BFI from another gage, another
tool, or a previously published figure when both sides used the same
method. Treating two BFI values as comparable without checking that is a
straightforward way to introduce an apples-to-oranges comparison that
looks perfectly reasonable on paper.

- ``"ih_smoothed_minima"`` (default): the UKIH/Institute of Hydrology
  smoothed-minima method (Institute of Hydrology, 1980; as codified by Wahl
  & Wahl, 1988, the most widely cited "Base Flow Index" definition and the
  one most reviewers will recognize by that name). Non-overlapping 5-day
  blocks; a block's minimum is a baseflow ordinate ("turning point") if 0.9
  times it does not exceed either adjacent block's minimum; ordinates are
  connected by straight-line interpolation, capped at actual flow (baseflow
  cannot exceed total streamflow). Needs no drainage area and is
  parameter-light, which is why it is the default here. Its non-overlapping
  blocks are anchored to the first date in the input, a known, published
  sensitivity of the method: shifting the same underlying series by 0-4
  days (changing which calendar days fall in which block, with no
  hydrologic meaning to the shift itself) moved a 2-year synthetic record's
  annual BFI between 0.9349 and 0.9391 -- a real if modest effect, worth
  knowing about before comparing this figure against the same site
  analyzed from a slightly different download window.
- ``"hysep_fixed"``, ``"hysep_sliding"``, ``"hysep_local_minimum"``: the
  three USGS HYSEP methods (Sloto & Crouse, 1996), all built on the same
  interval width ``N* = round_to_odd(2 * drainage_area_sqmi ** 0.2)`` days
  (Pettyjohn & Henning, 1979). Fixed-interval takes the minimum in each
  non-overlapping ``2N*``-day block as a flat baseflow value for that whole
  block (a step function -- the crudest of the three). Sliding-interval is
  a centered rolling minimum of window ``2N*+1`` (smoother, still a direct
  minimum, no interpolation). Local-minimum flags a day as a turning point
  when it equals the minimum of its own centered ``2N*+1`` window, then
  interpolates between turning points exactly as the IH method does. All
  three need ``drainage_area_sqmi`` -- there is no way around this; it is
  intrinsic to how HYSEP defines its window width, so a site missing that
  attribute cannot use these methods, and the error says so rather than
  guessing a drainage area or silently falling back to another method.
  **The N* constant above is implemented from secondary-source citations of
  Sloto & Crouse (1996) / Pettyjohn & Henning (1979), not a direct read of
  either primary document** -- this development environment has no network
  access to check it against USGS WRIR 96-4040 directly. The value is
  self-consistent (odd-integer rounding, the expected qualitative growth
  with drainage area) but that is not the same as confirming the constant
  itself is correct. Verify it against the primary source before relying
  on any HYSEP-derived number for a published result; if it is off by even
  a small factor, every HYSEP result built on it is systematically wrong,
  not just imprecise.
- ``"lyne_hollick"``: the Lyne & Hollick (1979) recursive digital filter,
  3 passes (forward, backward, forward) per Nathan & McMahon (1990),
  alpha=0.925. A single missing day would otherwise poison every
  subsequent value through the filter's own recursion (each day depends on
  the previous filtered value), so this implementation runs the filter
  separately on each gap-free run of the input and leaves gaps as NaN
  rather than bridging or resetting across them silently.

**Period-of-record summary.** :meth:`FlowRegime.summary` aggregates the
annual series two different ways, because they are not the same kind of
quantity: baseflow index and flashiness index are each a ratio of two
summable quantities (baseflow volume over total volume; total day-to-day
change over total volume), so their period-of-record value is computed by
pooling the numerator and denominator across every complete year and
taking one ratio -- volume-weighted, so a high-flow year is not given the
same influence as a low-flow year with far less water in it, which a naive
mean of per-year ratios would do. TQmean has no such pooled form, because
its threshold (that year's own mean daily flow) is itself year-relative; its
period-of-record value is the arithmetic mean of the per-year TQmean
values, which is what the term conventionally means.

    Parameters
    ----------
    daily_data : pd.DataFrame

    year_type : str
        Year definition; default "water".
    min_days : int
        Per-year completeness threshold. Default 350.
    method : str
        Baseflow separation method; see :func:`separate_baseflow` and the
        module docstring. Default "ih_smoothed_minima".
    drainage_area_sqmi : float, optional
        Required for the ``"hysep_*"`` methods.
    **method_kwargs
        Passed through to :func:`separate_baseflow` (``block_days``,
        ``factor``, ``alpha``, ``passes``).

    Returns
    -------
    pd.DataFrame
        Columns: ``year``, ``baseflow_index`` (NaN if incomplete or if the
        method found no valid baseflow ordinate in that year), ``n_days``,
        ``complete``, ``method``.

    Notes
    -----
    ``n_days`` counts only days where *both* total flow and separated
    baseflow are available -- the days that actually feed the ratio, not
    every day with a valid daily flow value. Every separation method
    leaves some days undefined (a warm-up run before the first identified
    turning point for "ih_smoothed_minima", "hysep_sliding", and
    "hysep_local_minimum"; the run of days spoiled by any gap in the
    input, for all five methods). Summing total flow over the whole year
    while summing baseflow over only the days it happens to cover would
    silently bias the ratio toward whatever is NOT represented in the
    unmatched days -- worst when a storm or a gap during high water falls
    in the unmatched stretch, since its volume then inflates the
    denominator with no matching contribution to the numerator.
    ``complete`` gates on this same matched day-set, not on `daily_data`'s
    own completeness, so a year missing no input data can still show
    ``complete=False`` if the separation method's own edge effects leave
    too much of it unmatched.

def diel_variation(
    iv_data: pd.DataFrame, tz: str, min_completeness_frac: float = 0.9
) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Per-day diel (within-day) variation statistics from an instantaneous series.

    Computes daily range, coefficient of variation, and related summary
    statistics for each local calendar day. This is descriptive only: it
    quantifies how much a stream's flow swings within a day, not why. A
    snowmelt-driven diel signal (afternoon melt pulse, overnight recession)
    and a hydropeaking or diversion-driven signal can produce a similar
    range or CV, and telling them apart requires knowledge of upstream
    operations (reservoirs, diversions, hydropower schedules) that this
    function has no way to know and does not attempt to infer. Treat every
    number this returns as "how much flow varied that day," not as an
    automatic natural/regulated classification.

    Parameters
    ----------
    iv_data : pd.DataFrame
        Instantaneous flow with a tz-aware datetime index and a ``flow_cfs``
        column -- the shape returned by
        :meth:`flowfreq.usgs.USGSgage.download_instantaneous_flow`.
    tz : str
        IANA time zone the data should be grouped by calendar day in, e.g.
        ``"America/Los_Angeles"``. Required, with no default: grouping by
        the index's own zone (typically UTC, per
        ``download_instantaneous_flow``'s default) instead of the gage's
        local zone silently fractures each local day across two UTC-labeled
        buckets, corrupting the range and CV of both -- this is not a
        hypothetical edge case, it happens on every single day for any
        site west or east of the UTC meridian. If `iv_data` is already in
        the zone you want, pass that same zone here; the conversion is then
        a no-op.
    min_completeness_frac : float
        Fraction of the day's *expected* observation count (inferred from
        the data's own median sampling interval; see Notes) that must be
        present for a day to be marked ``complete``. Default 0.9.

    Returns
    -------
    pd.DataFrame
        One row per local calendar day with at least one observation.
        Columns:

        - ``date`` : the local calendar date
        - ``min_flow_cfs``, ``max_flow_cfs``, ``mean_flow_cfs``,
          ``std_flow_cfs`` : float
        - ``range_cfs`` : ``max_flow_cfs - min_flow_cfs``, the day's diel
          amplitude
        - ``cv`` : ``std_flow_cfs / mean_flow_cfs``, NaN if the day's mean
          flow is not positive (a day that includes a zero or negative-
          treated-as-missing mean is not a meaningful denominator; see
          flowfreq.lowflow's module docstring on the same issue for annual
          minima)
        - ``n_obs``, ``expected_obs``, ``complete``

    Notes
    -----
    **Range and CV are reported regardless of completeness.** This is a
    deliberate departure from the annual/monthly/seasonal metrics earlier
    in this module, which report NaN for an incomplete period. A day
    missing some fraction of its readings (a logger gap, a brief outage)
    still usually captures most of the diurnal cycle, so its range and CV
    remain informative, just less precise, at partial coverage -- unlike an
    annual metric computed from a year missing an entire season. `complete`
    is there to tell you how much to trust the day's precision, not to
    gate whether a value is reported at all. A day with exactly one
    observation still gets ``range_cfs = 0`` (mathematically correct: a
    single point has no spread) but ``cv = NaN`` (a standard deviation needs
    at least two points) -- both are reported as computed, with `complete`
    correctly False.

    **Expected observations per day** are inferred from the *median* time
    step across the entire input, not a hardcoded assumption like 15
    minutes -- NWIS's most common instantaneous interval, but not the only
    one a logger might report at. If the sampling interval genuinely
    changes partway through the record (e.g. a logger upgrade from hourly
    to 15-minute reporting), this single global median will misjudge
    completeness for whichever era doesn't match it; split the record at
    the change and call this function on each piece separately in that
    case.

    **Negative values** are treated as missing, matching every other daily
    function in this library -- a data artifact, not a legitimate reading.

    Raises

        Fewer than two timestamps are available to infer a sampling
        interval from.
