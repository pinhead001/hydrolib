"""Compare hydrolib's native EMA against the committed Fortran output.

Runs everywhere, including CI, because the reference values come from a golden
file rather than from the extension. See ``tools/gen_fortran_golden.py``.

Structured as the diagnostic ladder in ``docs/FORTRAN_UPLOAD.md`` section 6:
each rung feeds the next, so the *first* failure is the root cause and anything
below it is downstream noise. Two rungs are known-failing and marked
``xfail(strict=True)`` -- they are real, understood defects, and strict means
the build fails the moment either starts passing.

    The far tail has *tightened its margin* since the bias-correction fix --
    Q100 was 0.88% and is now 1.59%. That is not a regression in the fit. The
    at-site skew went from 4.6e-3 off to 1.4e-4 off, which is what this rung's
    inputs are, but the quantiles are computed from the *weighted* skew, and
    that is still missing ADJE and Wd (-0.1157 against -0.1563). A skew error
    of that size shows up almost entirely at long return periods. Phases 4-5 of
    docs/VAR_MOM_PORT_PLAN.md close it.

    The bound stays at 3% rather than being widened to fit: 1.06x of headroom
    at AEP 0.002 is uncomfortable, and it should be. If it trips before those
    phases land, something else moved.
